## My open lab notebook

Hello! I'm Tad. I'm an ecologist and this is my lab notebook. It is largely a way for me to track my time and the status of ongoing projects. It holds me accountable, and provides a way of self-correction if I am spending too much time on certain tasks. 

For information about my science, check out my [website](http://taddallas.github.io). This lab notebook is mean to be a storehouse for project notes as I push projects forward. 

This blog was created on the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) platform, templating from [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com),and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/taddallas).

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to contact me, or report an issue on Github.

Thanks for reading!
