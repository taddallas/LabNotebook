## Open lab notebook

Eyo. I'm Dan, a PhD student in the [Odum School of Ecology](http://www.ecology.uga.edu), where I'm co-advised by [Sonia Altizer](altizerlab.uga.edu) and [Daniel Streicker](streickergroup.wordpress.com). For information about my research, check out my [website](danieljbecker.weebly.com). 

This blog was created on the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) platform, templating from [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com),and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/danieljbecker).

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to contact me.
