## What have I worked on?

Since my last update:

* `persistDistro`: pushed along analyses and text dev. Will discuss with Otso once more complete.

* `lsu`: started some e-shopping carts containing lab equipment and furniture for renovations.

* `labMeeting`: Marjo's lab meeting.

* `hmscZoops2`: started models running again, this time storing some different variables. 

* `checkerboard`: made revisions and responded to reviewers. Passed to collaborators.



### Tonight

* nothing.



## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeNiche`: get alpha hull working (stupid timeout issue)

* `gutInteract`: compare presence-absence to abundance model.

* `helmSize`: go over revisions and re-submit soon-ish
