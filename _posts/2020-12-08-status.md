## What have I worked on?

* `parmTime`: started at different initial parameters 100 times, to ensure convergence. Running now.

* `suitableProxy`: initial dev of idea with Colin and Sadie

* `helmSubset`: tweaks, Dan submitted revisions. Cool.

* `bioStability`: Drew revisions and some more code running to make a supplemental plot

* `website`: updated to include Lauren, a new PhD student in the lab.

* `helmCent2`: slotted for phil trans special issue. Reached out to Pedro. `helmNar` is a green light for revision submission by end of week.

* `reading`: read read read read 





### Tonight

* `turbo`: if the casette comes, set up the new turbo trainer...otherwise, `run`






## What should I be working on now?

* `ecologyLectures`: need to record them. Just can't find motivation. 

* `bioStability`: in my hands. Address Drew's comments, read that Valencia paper, and mash some supp plots together. 

* `parmTime`: push forward the narrative bits and try to really emphasize knowledge gap. 

* `suitableProxy`: let the computer go brrrrr while you set up protocol text and do some reading.
