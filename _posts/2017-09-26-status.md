## What have I worked on?
 
* `normalNiche`: partitioned up data and emailed Dave. Reading and writing. 
  
* `labLogistics`: plenty; none of which were fun. Want to know how [flour](http://www.madehow.com/Volume-3/Flour.html) is made!? 

* `macroHelminth` and `helmSize`: pushed along text dev and looped coauthors in on status and gaps






### Tonight

* `spatExtinct`: why is the code so slow? 





## What should I be working on now? 

* `normalNiche`: think and read

* `graphDissim`: respond to reviewers and perform supplemental analyses
