## What have I worked on?

* `epiControl`: getting code running on empirical data. Tough when you can't ssh into the high memory machines in the lab. womp womp wireless.

* `spectralSpread`: pushed along a bit, but it's a pretty slow process on this one.

* `flatEarth`: re-ran the decomp to get the full axis set. 

* `grant`: writing words in the correct areas

* `rangeShape2`: got sims running in background `beast1`





### Tonight

* `fyb`: volunteer from 3-6pm

* `run`: if you can get there by 6:30pm, then will run with group. Otherwise, 4-6 around lake if it's not raining. 

* `biol4253`: La Dispute and grading exams in the lab. 







## What should I be working on now?

* `eeid`: review grant as it stands and where your contribution is. 

* `biol4253`: grading and midterm grades entry.

* `scienceStuff`: ongoing projects. keep newer projects organized and get everything versioned. check on running stuff, and toss what you can on hpc_fugazi (tough part is the 72 hour limit on all jobs).
