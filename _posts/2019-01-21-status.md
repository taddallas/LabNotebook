## What have I worked on?

* `alandOcc`: not final meeting. Otso suggested more changes. 16 x 3 x 2 x 2 models. Good. Started model training, but hitting a bit of computational difficulty on Jarno's machines. Perhaps switch to rec machine? 

* `labMeeting`: presented my plans for Spain. It went alrigiht.

* `hmscMouse`: trouble-shooting conditional prediction functionality. 

* `professionalService`: knocked out one of the reviews









### Tonight

* `run`

* `pack-ish`: one week until move. Should probably start organizing stuff into piles at least. maybe clean something?

* `packDinner`: tomorrow I'll stay late and knock out as many genes as possible for the `geneAnnotation` project. Need foooooood though.










## What should I be working on now?

* `geneAnnotation`: I have like 15 genes to annotate in the next week. 

* `professionalService`: complete the two reviews and submit them.

* `sevilla`: get all the data ready to rock, and get the MPI side of things written into the HMSC approach.
