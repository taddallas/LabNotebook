## What have I worked on?

* `hmscMouse`: re-submitted. Geez! That revision took so much time and energy. It is definitely improved though. 

* `emergence`: submitted. This work has been a long time in the making, but is pretty solid in my mind. 

* `alandCrash`: pushed along a side idea related to this work, but sort of hit some barriers. Need to think about this more. 




### Tonight

* `courseMaterials` and `lsuLogistics`: I think I might have found a place to live, but we will see. 




## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeShape2`: fix memory leak issue. This will require a fair amount of work to re-factor code. 

* `socialSpread`: push along this idea
