## What have I worked on?

* `hmscTraining`: 6 hours of HMSC. woof.

* `hmscMouse`: got models running with updated package

* `professionalService`: completed one of two reviews




### Tonight

* `professionalService`: second review if I can handle it.

* `run`

* `read`: going to start a new book. Pretty excited. 




## What should I be working on now?

* `hmscMouse`: finish analysis. Make main and supplemental plots with the mixing considerations. Get the cross validation running and get the code in place to make the final plots at least. 

* `persistDistro`: write introduction.
