## What have I worked on?

* `helmBiogeog`: got things running on jarno10. Hanging on Japan because there is a lot of data for Japan.

* `helmCent`: working through piece-wise on jarno12

* `checkerBoard2`: sketched out responses to reviewer comments. Chatting with Alan and Brett early next week.

* `playNAR`: ran NAR without NODF and Q nulls. Need to think about how to incorporate a null, since many of these measures are sensitive to size and fill. Found really neat paper. Need to read it. 







### Tonight

* `mothSim`: sketch out introduction (think about how this relates to the community trajectory paper)

* `mothSync`: mappy maps.





## What should I be working on now?

* `helmX`: keep on. `helmCent` is on jarno12; `helmBiogeog` is slowly running on jarno10; `helmNets` minus mod/nest is donezo; get some stuff prepped and ready for mareNostrum, plenty of compute time to use.
