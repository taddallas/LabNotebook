## What have I worked on?

* `alandOcc`: submitted

* `helmNets`: played around with idea. Tossed some simulations on the cluster. 

* `logistics`: filled out and mailed off forms

* `helmStrength`: this project may be dead. Best trait data coverage I can get is like 75% of species, and that's for like 5% of networks. Es basura. Time to pivot.

* `professionalService`: reviewed article

* `helmCent`: some exploration and plotting of the randomizations. Coded up two further null models with different assumptions built in.

* `helmNets`: some code dev, but not ready to toss on cluster yet. 








### Tonight

* `mothSim` or `mothSync`: push along. Maybe some skeletal introductory material?

* `banco`: call so that my card works and I can buy food for survival.





## What should I be working on now?

* `helmCent`: toss updated nulls on cluster

* `helmNets`: this is low-hanging fruit. Push this along quicker.
