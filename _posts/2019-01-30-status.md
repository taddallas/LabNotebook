## What have I worked on?

* `sevilla`: traveled here and get settled in. Did tourist stuff and logistical stuff (groceries, etc.) the last day or so. Tomorrow I hit the ground running. 

* `mothSync`: pushed forward one interesting angle. Made two plots and need to sit and have a think on them. 

* `helmX`: divided the projects I'd like to attack here in Sevilla into three projects, each starting with `helm`, since I'll be using the London Natural History Museum's helminth data (with R access through the `helminthR` package).






### Tonight

* `chill` and `read`




## What should I be working on now?

* `helmX`: push these along

* `mothSync`: think and write
