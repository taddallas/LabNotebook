## What have I worked on?
 
* `rangeLean`: Robin updated code. Pushed along some manuscript tweaks, and some code organization/modifications 
 
* `priorityEffects`: still working through the likelihood issues. Tough nut to crack, turns out. 


* `parasitePartition`: Figured out the number of parasites I can get info on, and be sure to track the actual number of coinfections, instead of removing rows where that coinfection level was not observed (that way, I can plot number of coinfecting parasites along the x-axis). 



* `ecologySeminar`: listened to a talk





 
### Tonight 
 
* `rangeLean`: re-make plots with new code on empirical and model data to test new code and produce (hopefully) final plots. Re-write the panel plot code to just produce the one plot with the empirical and model skew fits on the same plot. 

 
* `dishes`: did not have the energy yesterday. 





 
 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `helsinkiTalk`: 5-10 minutes on why I don't suck. 
 

* cluster will be up soon, so get ready to push along `flatEarth`, `missingLinks2`, and `spatExtinct`
