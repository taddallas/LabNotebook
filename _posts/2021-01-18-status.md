## What have I worked on?

* `virion`: meetingin morning and then setup a decent github actions workflow. 

* `reading`: a bit of reading and thinking

* `mosquitoMagic`: cleaned code and got extra models running. Worked text a bit, but probably should discuss narrative with Colin

* `helmNAR`: 2nd round of revisions (one reviewer is a bit hard to satisfy I guess)

* `logistics`: you know. 




### Tonight

* `parmTime`: haven't pushed it forward in awhile

* `bike`: if up for it. Pretty sore and unmotivated right now.



## What should I be working on now?

* `finishUp`: lots of projects close to completion. Push them forward. 

* `otherStuff`: take stock and update the toDo file.
