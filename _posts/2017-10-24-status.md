## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects`: It's going somewhere, but the sensitivity of model convergence to initial parameter guesses is frustrating.
 
* `beetleMeeting`: updates on progress. Next meeting in two weeks. 

* `read`: some stalking of researchers to see what new stuff they've had come out. 

* `jobApp` 

* `linuxFun`: set up persistent memory Xubuntu on a USB on a Windows machine (Alan does not want to have Linux on it). Now I have another 8g machine with sudo access that I can run background processes on. 

* `thresholdDensity`: minor revisions that got backburnered before RCN meeting and other stuff. Set up responses file and read through them. Will push along this week. 

* `popBioSeminar`: amphibian physiological responses, adaptation, and climate change. 



 
### Tonight 
 
* `run`: was going to run workout with group, but may just try to get out for a longer run by myself. Prioritize mileage over interval work.

* `dishes`: 
 
* `rangeLean`: get Robin an updated climLat object. 
 



 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `thresholdDensity` and `nodeProperties` responses/edits 

* `priorityEffects`: confirm deletion diagnostic output, then update manuscript figures and text.
