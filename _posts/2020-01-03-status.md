## What have I worked on?

It's been too long. Holiday break and lots of logistics. 

* `cleber`: joined lab! Hooray!!!

* `spectralSpread`: Jane and I are pushing this work forward

* `epiControl`: I wrote some words. Am re-running some of the sim code with moar sims, but otherwise this is shaping up. Needs discussion section. 

* `logistics`: hustling for that funding. Some collaborative work with Colin and an NSF macrosystems grant in the works. 

* `reproResearch`: course design for Reproducible Research, a course I will attempt to teach in Fall 2020 to both undergraduates and graduate students. 

* `oldProjects`: trying to get older projects out the door, including `priorityEffects`, `dispersalTrait`, `helmX`, `persistDistro`, `checkerBoard2`, etc. 

* `moreLogistics`: lab shopping and shit for the wet lab system. It'll be good once it's done being nothing. Commented on Rebeca's proposal that I may become involved with (if she deems me cool enough). 





### Tonight

* `run`

* `read`




## What should I be working on now?

* `reading`

* `nsfMacro`: get this thing submitted before Jan 20.

* `oldProjects`: continue slowly getting stuff out.

* `logistics`: they never ever end.
