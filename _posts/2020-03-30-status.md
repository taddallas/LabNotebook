## What have I worked on?

* `rangeShape2`: revisions (have to get them back in within 1 month!) This is most of what I spent time on today. 

* `reproResearch`: a bit more course development

* `logistics`: grant proposal

* `bioStability`: a bit of writing

* `twitter`: read twitter like it was my job. Working from home is awful and I hate it. 





### Tonight

* `run`: though I am quite sore from taking the mountain bike out yesterday.

* `reading`: some good new stuff (e.g., Watling et al. 2020. "Support for the habitat amount hypothesis from a global synthesis of species density studies" looks pretty neat)




## What should I be working on now?

* `persistDistro`: sitting on my hands on this one until collabs get back to me.

* `helmX`: pretty much same story on these.

* `takeStock`: I've been hyperfocused on a small number of projects, and making sure I get fast feedback to folks in the lab. Need to sit back and chart out where all the projects are, and what's to be done in the future.
