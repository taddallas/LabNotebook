## What have I worked on?

* `nsfMacroB`: pushed along grant text a fair bit

* `bdhsSeminar`: four talks as part of the Big Data Health Science group here

* `regenSearch`: job candidate talk for regenerative biologist position

* `comments`: UG protocol draft comments, helped another UG with developing small grant proposal

* `ecolLet`: data editor for _Ecology Letters_. Told me I'd handle 2 manuscripts per month max. I've handled 4 in 2 weeks. 

* `fallTeaching`: what should I try to teach next fall? If I develop new course, it's min 3 courses developed pre-tenure, which seems like a lot. If I risk it and teach another round of _Reproducible Research_, I might not have enough folks in the room. 

* `neonVar`: some work on responding to reviewer comments. They were really constructive comments, getting at some of the core issues with measuring temporal variability from empirical time series data 

* `nihr21`: sent along more info (key/senior personnel form bits)



### Tonight

* `bike`: do the thing (not as hard as yesterday though)





## What should I be working on now?

* `nsfMacroB`: finalize it and maybe pass for friendly review before submission

* `neonTurnover`: good conceptual dev but need clearer questions and cleaner codebase (right now it's just a lot of visualization and data exploration) 

* `rangeNiche2`: keep pushing manuscript dev (intro, concept figure, preliminary sketches of figs, etc.)

* `neonVar`: edits nearly done, but need finalizing and figshare needs updating

* `theory`: create homework keys/rubrics, update website with new notes, etc.
