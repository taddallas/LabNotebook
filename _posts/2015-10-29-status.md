## What did I work on today?

* `srsMetacom`: worked on manuscript. Pushing to Github so collabs can comment/contribute.

### Prep for RCN

 * `speciesRichness`: applying species richness estimators to determine the number of host species a parasite can potentially infect

 * `insectDisease`: need to just knock the descriptive part out, then maybe brainstorm how these data can be used. 

* `globalHelminth`: Needs some writing love. Most of the plots are already made. Now I just need to weave that narrative (i.e. the hard part). 

* `RCN`: start slide prep with what I've been working on, and what I've found





## What should I be working on tomorrow


* More RCN prep

* Meeting with John

*
