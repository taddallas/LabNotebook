## What have I worked on?

* `neonTurnover`: pushed forward both conceptually and the actual analysis pipeline

* `logistics`: I remember handling a bunch of emails and other stuff, but I honestly do not recall what I did. Let's hope it was important (it was likely not). 

* `theory`: taught class. Went well.

* `nsfMacro`: grant meeting. Good science. 




### Tonight

* `publicInterest`: public interest auction to support law student stuffs

* `bike`: maybe. kinda toast from yesterday. 



## What should I be working on now?

* `logistics`: one-on-one meetings and lab meeting tomorrow, so reading and prep work in am.

* `neonTurnover`: continue pushing this forward

* `neonVar`: maybe try to get the edits and responses to reviewer finalized?
