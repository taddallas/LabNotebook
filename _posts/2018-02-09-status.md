## What have I worked on?

It's been long since I've updated this. Lots of logistics. 

* `jobStuff`: involves way more prep than I ever imagined.

* `emergence`: fixed small bug. Figures re-made, so it's time to write. 

* `priorityEffects`: edited and formatted. Passing to collaborators shortly.

* `rangeShapeComment`: responded to comment on recent _Ecology Letters_ article. Other reviewer echoed same points. Comment rejected. Pretty strange to read praise of paper not directed towards the author. 

* `finlandPrep`: residence permit, some moving logistics, learning how to curse in Finnish (perkele)




### Tonight 
 
* `jobStuff`: continue prep

* `packing`: keep on paring down stuff until it all fits in a Kia Rio

* `reading` 




## What should I be working on now?

* `jobStuff`: continue prep

* `checkerBoard`: Brett's edits and get it out the door

* `priorityEffect`: pass to collaborators when ready

* `missingLinks2`: nail down a couple of punchy findings and push the manuscript along
