## What have I worked on?

* `rangeLean`: re-visited, fixed some plots, and emailed with Robin. 

* `cv`: updated with the `nodeProperties` work. Tweaked cv style file in process.

* `hmscZoops`: believe I solved an issue we'd be hitting incorporating both spatial and non-spatial random levels. 

* `abundOcc`: sketched out some introductory text, and attempted to sharpen message. Laid down some initial code to explore some variance relationships, but it is buggy!




### Tonight

* `emergence`: tidy up and submit

* `twinPeaks`: watch an episode while working out. Do 10 pushups anytime something unsettling happens. 

* `docker`: refresh knowledge of docker and make a couple relevant images for analyses that I do, so that running things on other machines is a bit less painful.




## What should I be working on now?

* `abundOcc`: keep pushing along

* `esatTalks`: still haven't really practiced. Have written notes and tweaked slides though.

* `persistDistro2`: think about the conceptual problem more. There's something neat here, but I need to first think of the implications and measurement.
