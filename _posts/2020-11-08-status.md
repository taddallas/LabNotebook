## What have I worked on?

This got tweeted about, so now I'm trying to start posting again. So much of what I do now in my day-to-day is not science, but higher level organizing, management, and creating a space where folks in my lab can rock it. 

* `howManyHelminths`: this is now in press at PRSB. Long road, but solid finish. 

* `labOrdering`: ordered some stuff for the lab. Mainly to try to overcome networking issues i.e., remote machines not very useful if not reliably connected to LSU's network. Going to get them hard-wired, but that costs me money and time filling out forms to justify having an ethernet connection. yes, I need to justify this, and yes, it costs a few hundred dollars to make it happen. F&A off of grants does not cover this, I guess? idk. 

* `reproResearch`: finished final video (uploading to YouTube now). Need to eventually re-do with better webcam/microphone. 




### Tonight

* `reading`: "unsolved problems in ecology" and maybe some other stuff. 

* `bikeRide`: a bit windy, but whatever.





## What should I be working on now?

* `ecology`: teaching ecology next semester. Start recording some lectures now on campus. Need to re-visit my notes and make some changes from the first semester. Touch base with Daijiang on this soon. 


* `eeid`: working on grant dev. Need to sit down and see what still needs work.

* `keepThisUpdated`: what is time? Working from home is rough, and I don't think of recording daily time use anymore. Need to get better about it, because it does help partition time among projects more effectively, in my experience.
