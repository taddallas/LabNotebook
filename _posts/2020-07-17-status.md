## What have I worked on?

Long time since update. Been mainly using Github project board for tracking project progress, making this somewhat redundant. 

* `verena`: some logistic stuff and other cool advances with this group

* `epiControl`: reject despite generally positive reviews from PLoS Comp Bio. Currently adding some further analyses and re-factoring some text bits. Frustrating to see a similar (but far worse) approach come out in PLoS Comp Bio the same week as the rejection. The review process is a stochastic mess. 

* `reproResearch`: lots of dev.

* `logistics`: pulling in two graduate students in the coming fall/spring, and saying goodbye to a research associate. Trying to finish up existing projects with them, and keep pushing projects along of current PhD student and honor's undergraduate student. 

* `efi`: helping design forecasting challenge. Pretty neat. 

* `otherStuff`: science and stuff





### Tonight

* `esaTalk`: finalize and record

* `reproResearch`: record another lecture

* `run`





## What should I be working on now?

* `reproResearch`: finish up the recorded lectures asap

* `bioStabilityX`: push along, with Drew's help

* `verenaProjects`: do some project brainstorming

* `read`
