## What have I worked on?

* `helmSize`: passed to collaborators and wrote cover letter. 

* `proofs`: two article proofs (`wosFail` and a reply to a comment on `rangeShape`). 

* `persistDistro1`: code running with spatial aggregation baked in. Unlikely to change anything, but whatever.

* `persistDistro2`: laid down some code for combining close sites.




### Tonight

* `emergence`: null model implementation

* `read`: article from Andy Gonzalez on spatial networks




## What should I be working on now?

* `ideaGeneration`: what questions should I ask and what data should I be using?

* `resubmit`: a few projects have complete revisions, so it's about to be re-submission time.
