## What have I worked on?

* `alandOcc`: pushed along lots. Nearly ready to share

* `gitTutorial`: complete, more or less. Need to write out simple skeleton script of what I want to communicate. 

* `updateCV`: I fell asleep at 8pm yesterday (while sitting up), woke up at 10pm, slept from 11-1, was awake from 1-5, then slept until 11. I hate jetlag.


* `hmsc`: discussed parallelization ideas with Malcolm and Gleb



### Tonight

* `run`

* `sleep?`




## What should I be working on now?

* `persistDistro`: get ready to pass to collabs

* `hmscMouse`: respond to reviewers' comments

* `helmSize`: respond to reviewers' comments

* `emergence`: do stuff with reviewer comments soon-ish.
