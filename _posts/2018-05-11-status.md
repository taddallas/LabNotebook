## What have I worked on?

* `recMeeting`: discussed seminar course, gave updates, heard about ecological memory functions from Malcolm

* `closeEigen`: pushed along the simulation code and wrote some preliminary methods. 

* `wosFail`: finalized manuscript and sent pre-submission inquiry to target journal. Prepped template of REC cover letter to be used while I'm here. I think it's adaptable as well to changes in logo. The U California template was not flexible to this. 




### Tonight

* `pack`: leaving for Berlin on Saturday





## What should I be working on now?

* `persistDistro`: either figure it out or ask Jarno for help. 

* `hmscMouse`: start writing up some of the intro and methods paragraphs

* `abundanceSDM`: in Alan's hands. Once he signs off, submit it.
