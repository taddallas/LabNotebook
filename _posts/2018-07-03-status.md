## What have I worked on?

* `gutInteract`: repo set up with skeleton everything. Data formatted and ready to analyze. Nick invited as collaborator. This should move along decently quickly. 

* `rangeVar`: TRY data requested. Analysis pushed forward. Code running on jarno10 right now. 

* `persistDistro1`: code still running on jarno12. 





### Tonight

* `run`

* `tube`: check what size tube Anna's bike needs. Hopefully I can borrow some tire levers from somebody around here. 

* `clean`: my week to clean the house. 

* `read`: John Irving _Setting Free the Bears_. Best book in the very limited section of the local library with English books....unless I wanted to read shit romance novels. 



## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeVar`: push text dev along

* `helmSize`: read through one final time and push submission forward.
