## What have I worked on?

* `BoR-RCS`: finished the first draft of text. Needs budget justification and text refining.

* `logistics`: came up with good idea to pitch, so spent time developing it and reading

* `tivon`: meeting with honor's student to discuss project

* `books`: ordered some books for the lab. This involved some logistics of getting my stupid lacarte card to work, and dealing with Amazon Business garbage.

* `hsmcMouse`: accepted! proofing stage comes next. 





### Tonight

* `read`: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ecog.04444, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05649.pdf

* `comment`: comment on Colin's note



## What should I be working on now?

* `epiControl` and `spectralSpread`: text dev. 

* `server`: lab server should arrive Monday. Get it set up and get the `epiControl` code running on it (needs `screen`, `git`, `R`, `open-ssh`, ...)

* `reading`: need to do some reading and thinking.
