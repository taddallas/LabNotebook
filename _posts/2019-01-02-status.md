# Happy New Year!

## What have I worked on?

Lots of time since my last update. These are some of the highlights. I plan to be more on top of this in the new year for time management reasons. 

* `timeWithFamily`: it was a long break, and it was prettly lovely. 

* `checkerBoard2`: submitted.

* `dispersalTrait`: rejected with good comments from PRSB. Had some thoughts about it while jetlagged at 3am this morning, but for some reason can't seem to recall them. They were likely gibberish.

* `LSU`: more organizing and logistics (both personally and lab stuff) for the move.

* `otherLogistics`: getting prepped for time in Spain starting later this month. 

* `review`: reviewed two papers over break. Just asked to review another. Tis the season.





### Tonight

* `residencePermit`: need to renew residence permit. Start this ball rolling.

* `takeStock`: update manuscripts.md and list some projects that need to be pushed along (e.g., `emergence`)

* `read`: printed a paper to read if I can't sleep again. Also printed the article I need to review.




## What should I be working on now?

* `review`: do it.

* `priorityEffects`: take the day and just work on addressing reviewer comments for this work. 

* `hmscMouse`: check on this in the background, but damn this is taking a long time.

* `rangeNiche`: push this stuff along.
