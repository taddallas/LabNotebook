## What have I worked on?
 
* `logistics`: some travel logistics (previous and future), some Helsinki logistics, and some beetle lab logistics
 
* `undergradInterviews`: pulling in some more undergraduate researchers into the beetle lab. Interviews start today, but will likely continue after break. 


* `macroHelminth`: reviewers selected, files uploaded, and manuscript submitted

* `scramble`: showed Alan initial plots of the data to see what he thought. Will work with him next week on model structure. 


* `protocols`: determined which ideas were the least stupid, and pushed along protocols for them. Still super early stages. 

* `reading`: lots and lots.





 
### Tonight 
 
* `computer`: I bought a decent desktop computer that is small enough to take to Helsinki with me for $60. Tonight, I'm going to give it a thorough cleaning (the case has never been opened), and make it my own (Xubuntu, i3, R, LaTeX, Python, Julia, git, etc. etc.). 

* `whiteBoard`: some projects have recently been submitted, and the white board needs to be updated.

* `sellStuff`: start putting together list of things to sell off before I leave for Finland (take pictures and write descriptions). 



 
 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `protocolDev`: do it up. 
 
* `whiteBoard` and `computer` will probably spill into the weekend a fair bit.
