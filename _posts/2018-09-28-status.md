## What have I worked on?

* `recMeeting`: morning update meeting.

* `norbergDefense`: Anna's defense. She did great!

* `checkerBoard1`: accepted (quick response time!). Tweaked files, code/data, and submitted final files. Now we wait for proofs.







### Tonight

* `KORONKA`: traditional defense after party with fancy dress, formal speeches, and everything else ecologists are generally accustomed to.






## What should I be working on now?

* `birthday`: small birthday gathering tomorrow

* `rcnPack`: leaving Sunday for the US for a collaborative meeting. Looking forward to seeing old friends.
