## What have I worked on?

:tada: First day of the semester! :tada: 

* `theoryEcology`: put together intro to theory slides for Thursday, as I have all the course notes and homework done, except for the second day of class intro slides. 

* `websiteDev`: some logistics and scheduling for the website dev seminar 

* `magellanDev`: set up meeting with UG researchers to discuss ideas for Magellan small research grants

* `seminar`: two seminars today; EEB and a regenerative biology job candidate

* `nsf_bocp`: DEB coffee hour about the _biodiversity on a changing planet_ call. Interesting opportunity, but due in late March (maybe not enough time to put something together). 




### Tonight

* `zwift`: short tt to work on hard efforts, followed by longer group ride

* ``:


## What should I be working on now?

* `theoryEcology`: first day of class Tuesday

* `rangeNiche2`: writing overall structure (decide where to pitch this early, as it may influence structure)

* `neonTurnover`: some conceptual development and writing of the introduction (maybe a concept figure as well)
