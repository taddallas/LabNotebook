## What have I worked on?

* `helmNets`: still running on REC machine

* `helmBiogeog`: pushed along related idea that may or may not pan out. 

* `hmscMouse`: picked it up again, despite it being _really_ frustrating.




### Tonight

* `run`: north this time (south is pretty, but there are lots of people and no dirt)

* `groceries`: nom nom nom





## What should I be working on now?

* `mothSim` and `mothSync`: solidify some things over the weekend. 

* `helmX`: some writing. Get area and geographic coords for the biogeog project. 

* `reading`: lots of reading to do.
