## What have I worked on?

* `nodeProperties`: re-submitted. Fingers crossed.

* `persistDistroX`: code still running. Wrote up preliminary methods section for simulation exercise, and a bit of structuring introductory material for 0 and 1. 

* `persistDistro2`: tried to cement some of the initial ideas for this project. Currently doesn't have a simulation angle, so I could potentially push this forward while waiting on the simulations of `0` and `1`. 


* `rangeLean`: Robin emailed with extensive notes (bless her). Read through them, but need to dedicate more time to fully digest and incorporate them into the current manuscript. Started re-structuring the introduction, and gave the methods a bit more form. E-mailed Robin a quick clarification question. 


* `soleTm`: We keep timecards, and they are silly. I filled mine out for this month and submitted it so I can get paid. 


* `foxing2`: I did it again. Entire day of nothing but a single song from Foxing. Both songs are about Catholic guilt after having premarital sex. 







### Tonight


* `read` and `sleep`





## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeLean`: re-make plots based on Robin's feedback. Make introductory paragraphs clearer, and start sketching out main points and discussion skeleton. Definitely a weekend project.


* `persistDistroX`: keep plugging away. 


* `rangeVar`: start sketching out ideas related to this.
