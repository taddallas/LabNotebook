## What have I worked on?

* `bioStability`: finalized, formatted, and submitted

* `nsfMacro`: meeting with Lauren and Cleber to push this forward

* `logistics`: lab meetings, forms, class, etc. etc. 

* and like 6 other projects since I haven't updated this in awhile. Tough to recall what day it is with the pandemic, let alone update the lab notebook. Will try to be better. 


### Tonight

* `biol4253`: send out student email update on exam 2 and such. 

* `helmCent2`: work on addressing reviewer concerns



## What should I be working on now?

* `meetings`: literally the entire day is meetings tomorrow.
