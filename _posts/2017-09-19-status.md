## What have I worked on?
 
* `labLogistics`: more flour troubles, some cleaning and organization, screening of undergrad researcher applicants. Figuring out how feasible it is to enrich my own flour (pretty feasible actually). 

* `beetleMeeting`: discussed the `priorityEffects` paper. Small revisions for the most part. 

* `priorityEffects`: manuscript edits. Perturbing model fits and starting from different points to try and diagnose potential local optimum issues.

* `rangeLean`: calculated skew using Robin's measure and updated manuscript plots. Pushed to my branch. Need to sit down with Robin before anything gets tossed to master. 

* `abundanceSDM`: polished. Passed to Easton for his opinion on it. 



### Tonight

* `dishes`: more lab logistics basically. 

* `interviews`: email some potential undergrad researchers to set up interviews. 





  
## What should I be working on now? 

* whatever my Yalla tells me that I need to do? 

* `rangeLean`: work on manuscript text?

* `flatEarth`: work on edits for submission to another journal (_Nature_ rejected it)
