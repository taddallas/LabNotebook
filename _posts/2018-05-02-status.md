## What have I worked on?
 
* `voleIdeas`: put pen to paper on some vole-parasite ideas

* `annaSDM`: code almost done running, but hitting lots of file location errors. 

* `persistTime`: starting to play around with Aland data to look at persistence times. Distros are fit, but now I need to assemble the networks with the weird negative exponential dispersal link distance. 

* `logistics`: booking travel for upcoming BES macroecology conference, and trip to Manchester in mid June. 

* `hmscMouse`: single species models still running. Weird segfault issues that I can't seem to diagnose. It _has_ to be that there's NA, NaN, or Inf getting caught up in something, but I can't trace it. Annoying. I think it might be during k-fold cross-validation, if the subset data contain a response with no variation (all absences in an SDM sense) this could create an issue through calculation of variance or standardizing by variance leading to divide by 0 errors. 




### Tonight 
 
* `groceries`: MORE KALE!!! 

* `easton`: Skype with Easton in prep for his postdoc interview

* `read`

* `wosFail`: make some edits and reach out to Alyssa about submission. 

 
 
 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `annaSDM`: finish this up! Meeting on Friday. 
 
* `persistTime`: ask Torsti or Aapo about negative exponential link estimation.

* `voleIdeas`: polish it up and send to Otso for preliminary feedback.
