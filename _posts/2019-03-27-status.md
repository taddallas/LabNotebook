## What have I worked on?

* `rangeShape2`: started sketching out some code and ideas for funsies. Some stuff running on `jarno11`

* `helminthPres`: I give a seminar tomorrow, so I've been working on finalizing the presentation and prepping some notes, which I will immediately forget 10 seconds before the seminar starts.

* `hmscMouse`: asked for an extension as the models are taking stupid long to run. Slowly slogging through. Nearly time to start re-making plots and adding more to the manuscript. 

* `rangeShape1`: some minor tweaks. This thing is pretty ready to go in my opinion. 

* `abundOcc`: started submission process, but still waiting on on coauthor to sign off on it. 





### Tonight

* `run`

* `takeStock`: it's been awhile since I considered where my projects are, and where future projects should be. 





## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeShape2`: push it along slowly.

* `abundOcc`: submit when coauthor signs off.

* `hmscMouse`: push forward the text edits while the models run, in prep for the mass revisions.
