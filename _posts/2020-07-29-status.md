## What have I worked on?

* `reproResearch`: finished assignments and set them all up on Github classroom and Travis. Had to raise enrollment cap because the course got a bit popular with grad students. Chair of undegraduate studies in the dept says this is the largest "special topics" couse he has seen.

* `meetings`: `verena` meeting and an `efi` forecasting meeting

* `epiControl`: more code running on remote machine (`beast`)

* `helminthMeta`: running on `steinbeck`, but is pretty slow. Might need to re-think this one. 

* ``:




### Tonight

* `run`, `read`, `labMeeting`: life stuff and prep for lab meeting




## What should I be working on now?

* `takeStock`: where projects are at, what projects I want to move forward with, where are student projects, etc.
