## What have I worked on?

* `logistics`:

* `rangeShape`: pushed some of this forward. Passed to collaborators and responded to reviewers concerns (more of a "first pass"). 

* `mothSync`: started to respond to reviewer concerns. Needs some re-analysis I should be able to do pretty easily. 

* `rangeNiche1`: reject/resubmit decision on this, with most of the comments about a couple of methodological issues and incorporation of a proper null model. Pushed some of this forward.

* `logistics`: some grant garbage, installed more memory in my computer, etc.

* `Tivon`: talked about project status. Shaping up nicely. 





### Tonight

* `read`: couple of articles I've been really wanting to read

* `logistics`: may need to drop everything and pitch in towards last minute grant formatting effort.



## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeNiche`: start responding to reviewers and re-shaping the manuscript

* `mothSync`: same as above

* `stuff`
