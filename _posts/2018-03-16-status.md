## What have I worked on?
 
Moved to Finland. Took awhile to get a work computer and get it set up with Linux. Now I'm back. Helsinki is great. Time to start doing some science here. Also, need to finish up older projects.

* `RECmeeting`: going on retreat and prepped presentation for it
 
* `abundanceSDM`: revisions and further analyses for supplement
 
* `manuscripts`: submitted some manuscripts from work with Alan (`priorityEffects`, `checkerBoard`)

* `computerStuff`: Linux setup, deleted bloatware from University, gained acccess to high memory machines

* `researchStuff`: talked with Otso, Anna-Liisa, and Jarno about research






### Tonight 

* `beers`: beer with other postdocs and maybe some other REC folks
 
* `weekendPlans`: think of weekend plans. Can't leave country, but can explore locally. 
 
* `jobTalk`: some formatting of a job talk for April. 



 
 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `abundanceSDM`: scale analyses and responding to reviews
 
* `recIdeas`: push along research ideas for REC stuff

* `RCNprojects`: will miss the RCN meeting, but trying to push projects along from afar
