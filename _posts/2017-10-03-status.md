## What have I worked on?
 

* `flatEarth`: started responses to reviewers. Need cluster for this too though. 

* `normalNiche`: pushed literature review and introduction structure forward. 

* `read`
 




### Tonight

* `run`

* `beetleLab`: drill holes in patch lids and do some dishes

* `graphDissim`: analyses on home computer





## What should I be working on now? 

* `flatEarth`: need cluster access, but farm is all used up for the time being, and is being shut down for testing on Friday.

* `flourTest`: project status (data entry, EDA, etc.)

* `experimentalIdeas`: sketched out experimental ideas to pitch to Ivan (or to be run in the future)
