## What have I worked on?

* `easton`: caught up with him and talked about potential project

* `coffeeTable`: it came and I assembled it.

* `ecol4253`: polished off lecture notes (and gave lecture). 

* `helmCent1`: code is re-running to make sure I didn't include geographic locations I should have excluded. Code done. Laid down some new plotting code to replace ugly plots. Next is just polishing edits.


* `DEPRSCoR`: emailed folks to confirm something yesterday, but no word yet. 

* `logistics`: small update to website, took LSU driver training, reimbursement for RCN meeting, just a bunch of bullshit if I'm being honest.

* `helmCent2`: some polishing edits (waiting on a question to Pedro about thresholds).

* `epiControl`: still running on home computer. Should be done in a couple of days.

* `rangeShape2/3`: 2 is in Luca's hands before simulations start back up. 3 was passed to collaborators yesterday and is due later this month.
