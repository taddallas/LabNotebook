## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects`: update manuscript text with model fits (make sure fit is stable). Perhaps discuss the inclusion of the new data with Brett and Alan.

 
* `teary`: discussed stuff. drank coffee.

 
* `logistics`: finalized short research talk. Thought a bit about how this would become a job talk (which projects to really emphasize and the common theme holding them together).


* `labLogistics`: spent 3 hours in the lab sifting beetles. 
 



### Tonight 
 
* `rangeLean`: update plots and check out distribution of empirical abundance values. 
 
* `RCNlogistics`: paperwork and whatnot.





## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `rangeLean`: push text along. Robin's pushing this along as well. 
 
* `nodeProperties`: responses to reviewers (nearly done).
