## What have I worked on?

* `labMeetings`: Anna-Liisa and Marjo lab meetings

* `checkerBoard`: edited and formatted for _JAE_. One last read through for clarity, and passed to collaborators.

* `hmscMouse`: writing. lots of writing. some reading. mostly writing.






### Tonight

* `run`

* `emergence`: read through code and make sure everything looks solid (Colin had some concern over the number of pathogens not matching some Excel file) 







## What should I be working on now?

* `hmscMouse`: more writing

* `persistDistro`: clarification of theoretical expectations and introduction writing
