## What have I worked on?

* `sapHR`: logistical work plan stuff

* `abundanceSDM`: went over proofs and submitted

* `alandOcc`: minor edits concerning focus and passed to Otso for his opinion on it. 

* `hsmcZoops2`: bit of code dev and now running on jarno12. Going realllllllly slow though. 

* `website`: updated with two recent pubs and a badge for helminthR downloads

* `persistDistro`: missing screen instance (likely my fault), so I restarted the small simulations...should be done sometime next week. :/





### Tonight

* `read`: got Vonnegut "Sirens of Titan" from the library.

* `run`: either outside or at the gym. 





## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeNiche`: This is the next thing I want to push along.
