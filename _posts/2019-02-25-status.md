## What have I worked on?

* `labMeeting`: heard about ongoing projects from Lica and Irene

* `paperDiscussion`: lunch-time paper discussion

* `helmBiogeog`: re-making figures with updated distance to mainland calculation, and a fair bit of writing.

* `helmCent`: sit and think about it. 




### Tonight

* `helmBiogeog`: some more writing

* `hastingsLab`: prep California postdoc project updates (science goes slowly)

* `labPres`: I present in lab meeting next week, so maybe sketch out what I want to present?

* `run`: start getting more distance, and do more core work and plyometrics (I've been lazy about it). 



## What should I be working on now?

* `helmBiogeog`: push it along to a point where it can be shared with labmates for comments.

* `helmNAR`: running on jarno12

* `hmscMouse`: respond to reviewers and troubleshoot models. All code is now switched to S3 implementation (dumb)
