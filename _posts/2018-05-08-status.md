## What have I worked on?

* `abundanceSDM`: worked on `emergence` last night instead, so pushed along manuscript dev this morning. Took nearly all morning. Woof. 

* `Hmsc`: new R package. Played around with it. 

* `hmscMouse`: adapted example code to use new `Hmsc` package

* `persistDistro`: read and tried to understand how to estimate tau. Oof.



### Tonight 

* `featherPaper`: read and edit old feather paper

* `run`



## What should I be working on now? 

* `rangeLean`: touch base with Robin

* `professionalService`: review article

* `persistDistro`: keep reading. It'll make sense eventually.
