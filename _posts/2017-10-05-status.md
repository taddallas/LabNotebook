## What have I worked on?
 
* `HMSCzoops`: meeting to discuss potential directions and initial data formatting stuff

* `priorityEffects`: got likelihood issue straightened out and figured out mutual invasibility criteria. 

* `graphDissim`: procrustes analyses, re-made figures, added supplemental Table for the Mantel stuff, and responded to reviewers. Nearly done. Just need a bit of polishing.








### Tonight

* `rangeLean`: add data to panel plot. Prep for Friday meeting

* `run`




 
## What should I be working on now? 

* `RCN`: pack and prepare for RCN meeting

* `emergence`: push along approach. Make map of emergence events to show the disparity in reporting.

* `normalNiche`: continue working the introduction
