## What have I worked on?

* `seminar`: gave short talk on `alandOcc` project. Some good feedback. Set up meeting with Torsti to discuss stuff further, and running some more analyses now. Recorded the screen and vocals, and will make available once I confirm it's alright to share with Marjo and Torsti. 

* `gutInteract`: set up code and got stuff running. 

* `read`: still interested in how people have assessed network change over time when nodes can be on/off. Read the classic metapopulation dynamics review (Hanski 1998). 

* `europaApp`: will submit early next week. Still putting some polishing touches on it. 

* `helmSize`: Shan edited. Went through to handle some of the smaller polishing suggestions made by reviewers.








### Tonight

* `read` and `run`

* `takeStock`: update manuscript.md, sketch out status of current projects, and think about next steps




## What should I be working on now?

* `gutInteract`: running now. Push it forward on Monday.

* `alandOcc`: same.
