## What have I worked on?

* `email`: so. many. emails.

* `epiControl`: pushed this along in a big way. Methods written (for the most part), intro sketched out, project is on Github now. 

* `labLogistics`: communicated with prospective graduate students

* `rangeShape3`: put some edits down and passed back to collabs for polishing edits before submission.

* `emergence`: this work was accepted at _Royal Society Open Science_, so that's good news.

* `biol4253`: two lectures left before second exam.

* `helmCent1`: made pretty plots

* `tivon`: passed along the data that will serve as the basis for his honor's thesis. Exciting times.




### Tonight

* `run`

* `read`: couple of articles printed out

* `grants?!`: sketch out some steps forward for a couple grant submissions.








## What should I be working on now?

* `mothSync`: dust it off, incorporate reviewer concerns (even the dumb ones), and submit elsewhere. 

* `epiControl`: write words good.

* `rangeShape2`: run simulations after making sure Luca's cool with approach. 

* `epiControl`: realNets run on `beast2` when it arrives (side to-do: set up `beast2` when it arrives).
