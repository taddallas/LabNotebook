## What have I worked on?

* `HMSCmouse`: submitted.

* `professionalService`: review completed.

* `moth`: one solid question sketched out with some backing code. Unsure how to deal with the very seasonal nature of things, but I have some thoughts. 

* `persistDistro2`: emailed Aapo about the occupancy stuff to hear his thoughts. 

* `helminthR`: submitted to CRAN. 



### Tonight

* `moth`: create repo for the occ idea, and start fleshing it out. 



## What should I be working on now?

* `ESA`: practice talks at some point just to make sure I can hit time limits.
