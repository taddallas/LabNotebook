## What have I worked on?

* `helminthR`: removed `ggmap` dependency, and tweaked `cleanData.R` functionality. Updated Github and released to CRAN. v.1.0.7

* `priorityEffects`: commented on Geoff's revised abstract and intro. They look great. 

* `sevilla`: explored, went running, and went to a music festival for a bit yesterday, but today I have a cough and feel a bit sick. So it's tea, sitting in my bed, and alternating between easy work, duolingo-ing it up, and watching bad tv. 

* `CV`: updated.

* `helmX`: worked on re-factoring `helmCent` code to run on cluster






### Tonight

* `read`: non-academic book time.






## What should I be working on now?

* `helmCent`: get null model running on the bsc-cluster. This will involve a fair amount of initial handholding to move all needed packages over and such. 

* `alandOcc`: submit it.

* `helmX`: push along

* `emergnce`: polishing edits and prep submission.
