## What have I worked on?
 
* `rangeLean`: getting on same page with Robin. Pushed along panel plot with simulations and data combined. Some structural re-organization among the numerics and analytics files
 
* `spatExtinct`: touched base with Colin on current status and next steps

* `labLogistics`: made 1 job offer so far. Will likely make the other two shortly. 

* `priorityEffects`: addressed Brett's comments on results and explored some of the likelihood stuff. Running into a weird issue, where likelihood values match among models under certain parameterization (expected), but likelihoods are different than the likelihood of the model fits. 







### Tonight

* `run`: easy 5 because yesterdays 3 x 2 mile (3 min rest) was brutal

* `rangeLean`: finish off the panel plot (meeting with Alan on Friday)





## What should I be working on now? 

* `emergence`: push along approach. Make map of emergence events to show the disparity in reporting.

* `normalNiche`: continue working the introduction
