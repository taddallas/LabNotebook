## What have I worked on?

It's been awhile. My bad. Traveling and logistic work got in the way of actually recording what I did. A quick summary below for my own sanity.

* `abundanceSDM`: re-submitted to _Global Ecology and Biogeography_

* `hmscMouse`: bunch of model updates. some writing. some supplemental analyses. 

* `professionalService`: reviewed 2 articles, got asked to review 3 more. Shit.

* `esa`: registered for meeting and did travel logistics

* `besMacro`: made sweet poster.

* `nodeProperties`: revisions. Comments mostly positive. Some supplemental analyses necesary, but editor doesn't want supplement to grow much. I agree. Worked on edits, and will re-submit next week. 



### Today

* `macroHelminth`: minor revisions. Finished off edits today, and will re-submit the manuscript this week. 

* `hmscMouse`: manuscript writing and polishing

* `persistDistro`: sketched out introduction and thesis a bit better.

* `review`: worked on one of the reviews I agreed to. 

* `osnabruck`: giving an invited seminar in Osnabruck in December. Stoked to see folks there, but took me an unreasonable amount of time to decide on what I wanted to talk about and what the title of my talk will be. 




### Tonight

* `nodeProperties`: supplemental analyses and finish responding to reviewers.

* `run`





## What should I be working on now?

* `persistDistro`: keep pushing it along.

* `macroHelminth` and `nodeProperties`: get them in submission shape. 

* `priorityEffects`: Alan said go time. Check with Brett.
