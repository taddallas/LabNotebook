Just getting back into the swing of things after backpacking with my dad in King's Canyon. Feeling refreshed and ready to do some science. 


## What have I worked on?

* `yalla`: trying to use for project management. The open lab notebook approach leaves some detail to be desired, as well as time management, etc.

* `rangeShape`: figshare repo containing code and data updated and ready for production. Just made public. Boom. 

* `priorityEffects`: re-fit models with species-speciifc stochastic effects. Incorporated much of Brett's comments, but not all. Worked on results section.

* `abundanceSDM`: polished main text and edited supplemental material. Fixed some supplemental figures. 

* `graphDissim`: really constructive reviews at _Ecography_. Created a response document and read through and thought about the reviewers' concerns. 






### Tonight

* `priorityEffects`: fix plots per Brett's suggestions. 

* `rangeLean`: use Robin's skew measure for empirical data.

* `yalla`: get all projects up on there and get stuff organized. I think it's going to work (repeat over and over). 

* `food`: need to go grocery shopping crazy badly. 






## What should I be working on now? 


* `beetleMeeting`: tomorrow (not today)...oops. Be ready to discuss `priorityEffects` changes. Have updated figures. Ask Geoff about relevant citations for two-species stochastic _co-existence_

* ``:
