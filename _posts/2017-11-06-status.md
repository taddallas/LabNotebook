## What have I worked on?
 
* `teary`: drank some coffee and talked about postdod logistics for graduate students
 
* `spatExtinct`: discussed the project with Colin. Some next steps which are hopefully not dead ends. 

* `rangeShape`: the _Ecology Letters_ pub will receive a comment (sort of expected). Need to sit down with Alan and Robin and discuss the concerns. None of this is negative. I'm looking forward to creating a dialogue. 

* `professionalService`: worked on article review. 

* `flatEarth`: addressed one reviewer comment but forgot to change something else about the models. Silliness. Running models again to address the reviewer comments completely. Worked on text edits to main and supplement. 






### Tonight 

* `rangeShape`: push along some side analyses

* `beetleMeeting`: prep for beetle meeting. Hopefully `priorityEffects` will be ready to submit shortly.





## What should I be working on now? 


* `flatEarth`: try to find some free cluster space and get the models training (again).


* other stuff
