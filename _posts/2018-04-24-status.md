## What have I worked on?
 
* `abundanceSDM`: reviewers want me to model both occurrence and abundance using same climatic covariates, and then relate them to one another. I think the way I approached the problem was more elegant, and didn't run the risk of ill-fitting models fit to the same covariates resulting in spurious correlations between model estimates, but guess what I'm doing? Training a shit ton more models to appease reviewers, while still maintaining the original analysis in the supplement for transparency. 


* `HMSCmouse`: got feedback on this project at the meeting yesterday. Implementing some of the changes. Folks aren't sold on the species assocaition angle, so I may have to re-focus. Laid down some code for this re-focusing. 


* `alandIdeas`: did some reading and sketched out ideas for the Aland island metapopulation data. This is definitely a work in progress, but will eventually discuss ideas with Marjo to see what's been done and what's viable. 


* `helmSize`: went through and made smoothing edits to introduction, and got about 1 paragraph into the discussion. Perhaps try to push this along tonight? 






 
### Tonight 

* `helmSize`: discussion edits and smoothing. 

* `emergence`: some edits to introduction necessary.






## What should I be working on now? 

* `abundanceSDM`: keep pushing along analytical changes and manuscript dev. 

* `alandIdeas`: send the ideas to Marjo and see if she'd sit down and talk about best routes forward.
