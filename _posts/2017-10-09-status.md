## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects`: still pushing the likelihood and model analytics stuff along. Emailed Brett for some help. 
  
* `emergence`: touched base with Tim and Colin about this project. Progressing nicely. Tim proposed testing for influence of gap years, and I proposed hindcasting as another potential avenue. 

* `RCN`: prepped for meeting. Trying to get ducks in a row so we can get the most accomplished during meeting time. 

* `ivan`: began to conceptualize a project that sounds promising. I'm giving him the week to start to develop the protocol independent of my input (though I'm available for feedback as he works at it). Neat stuff. 

* `kelsey`: provided some feedback about her _Daphnia_ protocol. It sounds like a cool study, and I'm excited to see how it turns out. 



### Tonight

* `RCN`: fly to New York.




## What should I be working on now? 

* `RCN`
