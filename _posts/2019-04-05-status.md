## What have I worked on?

* `rangeNiche1`: found bug in code so had to re-make a couple of plots. No big changes, but they look better now. 

* `labMeeting`: heard from Irene and Ana about their current and proposed work. Really good stuff.

* `hmscMouse`: diving into the variance partitioning function and re-training a couple of models with differing fixed and random effects. Went through reviewer comments and responded to most. It's shaping up into something. 

* `rangeShape2`: models set up and running




### Tonight

* `rangeShape3`: need to sketch out a contribution to the special issue where everybody criticizes my work. Attacking attempts to test conceptual theory on the basis of measures used or data limitations is like saying "hey, we _know_ something is there, so the fact that you don't see it is on you". It's tautological at best, and not a great way to do science. garbage. 

* `rangeNiche1`: edit the plots and keep pushing along manuscript.

* `takeStock`: project status upadte.




## What should I be working on now?

* `run`: second to last weekend in Sevilla. So I will definitely be out soaking up the sun and doing some nice runs around town. 

* `hmscMouse`: work towards re-submission (it's close)

* `rangeShape2`: plotting and writing

* `otherStuff`: IDK. Need to `takeStock`. Some `lsuLogistics` probably. Moving and whatnot. Course material dev for `introEcology`.
