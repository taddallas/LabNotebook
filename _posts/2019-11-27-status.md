## What have I worked on?

* `croninChat`: talked with Cronin about some projects and life in general. He is a wealth of information.

* `professionalService`: reviewed a manuscript.

* `logistics`: some email responding, cover image bullshit, press release, reading about REU sites, etc.

* `grant`: wordy word type type. 





### Tonight

* `run`: been getting better about going by myself, but need to start working in longer runs (9-10 last weekend was the longest I've run in 6+ months). Scraping 20 mile weeks if I'm lucky. 

* `groceries`: Not looking forward to the Thanksgiving rush, but I doubt my can of black beans, apple, and almond milk will take me very far. 

* `takeStock`: sketch out where projects are, focusing on umbrella grants, and future timeline.







## What should I be working on now?

* `grantz`: write words, get money, do science.

* `epiControl` and `spectralSpread` sitting there done. Flesh out manuscripts. 

* `rangeShape2`: sims done. Do some final word polishing and then send to collabs.

* `dispersalTrait`: revise and resubmit
