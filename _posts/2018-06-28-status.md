## What have I worked on?

* `hmscMouse`: incorporated second round of comments from Anna-Liisa. New discussion paragraph, some grammatical edits, and some introduction tweaks. It's shaping up pretty nicely. 

* `persistDistro0`: implemented incidence function model for simulations instead of my approach. I feel like people get touchy when deviations from established methods are made. The results will be the same regardless. Got the code running on Jarno's machines (again), but the results (if not shit) should be useful for both `persistDistro0` and `persistDistro1`.

* `foxing`: It's not much of an accomplishment, but I've listened to nothing but one Foxing song on repeat all day. I haven't taken my headphones off except for lunch. 




### Tonight

* `read`: Adler et al. 2018 _Ecology Letters_



## What should I be working on now?

* `persistDistroX`: keep documenting and pushing along. Do some reading, and perhaps some introduction writing for at least one branch of this diffuse project.
