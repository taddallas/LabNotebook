## What have I worked on?

* `logistics`: so many of them... like, a crazy amount. Every object coming into the lab has be to unpacked and a detailed expense report filled out on it. Other paperwork is plentiful. Ongoing training, faculty lunches, and meetings.

* `swNetworks`: data acquisition for this project with Jane and Jason. Required an IRB, which is a bit of a bear to complete. 

* `sDiv`: full proposal development. Pretty excited about the idea. Fingers crossed it gets funded.

* `professionalService`: editorial duties 

* `rangeNiche`: pushed idea along some more, made a null, and looked at some scaling relationships. Need to sit down and decide on final figures and conceptual aspects.

* `outTheDoor`: got a couple of projects submitted or re-submitted (`rangeShape2`, `dispersalTrait`). Need to get a couple more off my plate so I can focus more on current projects.

* `spectralSpread`: out for friendly review. 






### Tonight

* `read`: lots of great work has come out recently (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0791-2, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.09.940494v1.full.pdf, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.947531v1.full.pdf, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.943811v1.full.pdf) I need to read it.

* `run`: if it's not raining.







## What should I be working on now?

* `recruitment`: grad recruitment this Friday-Saturday. Pretty excited.

* `sDiv`: keep pushing this forward (specifically timeline and conceptual figure).

* `reproResearch`: course design necessary. I will probably put this off, but probably shouldn't. 

* `helmNAR` and `helmBiogeog`: finish up and submit.
