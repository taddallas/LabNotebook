## What did I work on today?

* Threshold host density model development. Got stochastic model working with some tweaks, so now I need to focus on plotting, and changing the manuscript text to emphasize stochastic framework (one paragraph should suffice)

* Met with JP and John to discuss rocky outcrop community ecology projects. Unsure where/if/how I will be contributing.





## What should I be working on tomorrow?

* Push the threshold stuff along as far as you can. This needs to get re-submitted before too long. 

* Dissertation concluding chapter. Intro is in halfway decent shape, but discussion is hardly touched.

## Sometime soon

* James Carmon Scholarship application? 

* SRS project thinking + updating repo

* some RCN project protocol work related to `GlobalHelminth` stuff

## Back of mind
