## What have I worked on?

* `mothSync`: live on PRSB (https://t.co/lKUvgtlWax?amp=1)

* `bioStability`: big steps forward in analysis and manuscript writing

* `labFlooding`: dealing with all that

* `inFocus`: more manuscript dev (submit this week) with lots of great contributions from Lauren and Grant

* `swNetworks`: meeting and some ideas pushed forward. 

* `helmSubset`: pushed this along a bunch with Dan writing some solid bits




### Tonight

* `read`: lots of neat science





## What should I be working on now?

* `helmX`: get these submitted soon-ish.

* `reproResearch`: more course dev. Need to start thinking about recording lectures (probably run through them all in July and knock out recordings)

* `newIdeas`: push some ideas forward and structure them around potential grant proposals
