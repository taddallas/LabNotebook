## What have I worked on?

* `logistics`: set up 4 desks, 2 couches, 6 lab benches, cleaned the lab, got the biosafety cabinet installed, incubator is now running. Lab is starting to look a bit more like a lab. The first high memory machine arrived and is getting set up. Will be in my office until students come, when it gets 64 more gigs, slurm, and no monitor to go in the main lab. Hung some stuff on the walls and got a coffee pot, so I think I'm good. 

* `alandOcc`: responded to reviewers concerns and passed to collaborators

* `abundOcc`: accepted at _J Biogeography_ 

* `mothSync`: submitted

* `persistDistro`: so close to being submitted. Incorporated a bunch of changes, but a bit more back and forth on comments from coauthors before this is ready. 

* `professionalService`: reviewed one article.




## What should I be working on now?

* `professionalService`: two more review requests that I stupidly accepted.

* `atlanticNetworks`: push along some analyses

* `priorityEffects`: update table, add a line or two to the methods, and get this ready to re-submit

* `logistics`: more ordering, assembling, organizing, etc. to do.
