## What have I worked on?

* `nih`: lifetime total of 2 grants submitted, 2 grants not discussed. Frustrating.

* `theoryEcology`: going well. Completed second hw rubric and will need to read paper summaries and grade homework over weekend. 

* `logistics`: expense report, tons of forms for collaborative grant (still trying despite constant failure), computer set up for Anthony, meetings, meetings, faculty senate, etc. etc. etc. 

* `neonTurnover`: worked on text edits and methods (some minor figure tweaks as well)




### Tonight

* `grading`: maybe get the theoretical ecology grading started? 




## What should I be working on now?

* `grants`: probably need to keep submitting until I have some money for the lab, right?
