## What have I worked on?

* `logistics`: grant proposal dev.

* `persistDistro`: finalized revisions. emailed with Anna-Liisa. I think it's ready to go

* `epiControl`: submitted and then desk rejected. Issues of journal fit, which I can understand. It's tough to find a perfect fit for this, but we tried PRSB first because we wanted that broad readership. Aiming for PLoS Computational Biology next.

* `helmSubset`: project idea that I thought of the other day, based on a conversation with Dan Becker. Models running now. Will pull him and some others in on it if it turns out to be anything. 

* `sDiv`: proposal dev. Due in less than a week. 

* `networkEpi`: workshop and group project. Pretty neat stuff. 

* `spectralVar`: more of an idea currently. Wrote some code and it's running on `beast2`. We'll see how it looks in a few days (I didn't say I wrote efficient code).

* `reproResearch`: a bit of course dev. Hopefully it'll be taught in person. Otherwise, it might present some logistical challenges.

* `carpentriesTraining`: 2 days of training to become a Carpentries instructor. 




### Tonight

* `run`: allergies have been bothering me, but I need to get out of this tiny tiny space.





## What should I be working on now?

* `persistDistro`: re-submit

* `logistics`: dev dev dev

* `otherStuff`
