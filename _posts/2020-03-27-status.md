## What have I worked on?

Coronavirus and me being lazy has upset my normal posting routine. I'll hit the highlights of what I've worked on, but I'm probably leaving things out. I'll hopefully be better in the future about posting.

* `logistics`: research continuity plans and switching everything to online mode actually took a bit of work (forms, numerous Zoom calls, etc.)

* `mothSync`: incorporated comments and re-submitted. `persistDistro` is almost ready to re-submit too, which I think is the last ongoing U Helsinki postdoc project that I'm first author on.

* `spectralSpread`: handed this to Jane and she took off running with it. Super solid work, will hopefully be submitted sometime this week.

* `osorioReproduce`: submitted a comment on a recent Ecol Letters article. We'll see if editors and reviewers think it's good or trash. 

* `rangeShape2`: comments back from Ecography were really positive and constructive. A bit of clarification on model structure to address them, but am hopeful that we can address them all.

* `swNetworks`: collaborative project largely led by Jason and Jane. Data is there, and by next week we should have some nice plots.







### Tonight

* `Run`

* `Read`: Vonnegut "Galapagos"

* `bike?`: the other day I saw a bike in the overgrowth around LSU lakes that looked super abandoned. Might see if it's still there, and if so, see what it would take to fix it up for funsies.








## What should I be working on now?

* `helmNAR`: submit soon.

* `logistics`: some grant related stuff to push forward

* `bioStability`: some manuscript writing. Need to solidify meta-narrative.
