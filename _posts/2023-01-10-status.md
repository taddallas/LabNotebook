## What have I worked on?

* `insectDisease`: r-lib/actions fix to get the GitHub Actions working nicely

* `theoryEcology`: small updates and website build updates. Teaching in afternoon. 

* `logistics`: some website dev late additions (up to 15+ folks interested)

* `r21`: wrote the bulk of my aim and sent to collaborator for edits/ideas

* `labNotebook`: kind of meta, but fixed weird Spotify link issue with the embedded track stuff. 

* `rangeNiche2`: officially got it on GitHub, and spent some time sketching out manuscript structure



### Tonight

* `bike`: tt plus another semi-tough ride yesterday. Just do like 1 hour easy spin today probably. 

* `sleep`: go to bed before midnight?



## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeNiche2`: strike while iron is hot. Keep the writing and reading going. 

* `magellan`: meeting to discuss Magellan grant ideas and some fun UG projects

* `nsfCyber`: reach out to program officer to chat about updated budget and potential flaws based on reviewers' comments. I think the resubmission is looking strong, but what do I know?
