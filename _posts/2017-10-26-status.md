## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects`: re-fitting models and adjust manuscript accordingly. Sims will be started tonight

* `schrieberLab`: Sebastian gave a practice talk on his work on the consequences of trait variation. Good stuff.

* `dispersalTrait`: add the supplemental analysis to demonstrate a lack of effect of painting on beetle movement.

* `jobApp`: another one.

* `nodeProperties`: continued responding to reviewers

* `esaInspire`: trying to organize an Inspire session proposal with Noam Ross (his idea).







 
### Tonight 
 
* `priorityEffects`: sims
 
* `nodeProperties`: explore some of the predictability questions the reviewers raised, and examine the distribution of centrality values in the networks. 

* `rangeLean`: climLat objects formatting 





 
 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* push along `normalNiche`, `nodeProperties`, `rangeLean`

* `abundanceSDM`: add citation for applied consequences (invasive plants)

* `read`
