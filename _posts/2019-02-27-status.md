## What have I worked on?

* `helmNAR`: pushed along some different ways of measuring nestedness. Everything seems sensitive to matrix size and fill though, so that's not ideal. 


* `helmBiogeog`: pushing along. Mostly in Tim's hands currently, but coded up Bastolla's eta measure and spectral radius, edited main text a bit. 


* `abundOcc`: rejected from Ecography. It's a bit fresh, but I don't really think the reviewers were reading my paper, but rather the one they wanted me to write. 


* `hmscMouse`: still slogging through



### Tonight

* `run`: running group for an easy 8k + whatever I add on.

* `read` and `think`: next steps for `helmCent`, something about how forbidden links are silly?, idk.





## What should I be working on now?

* `abundOcc`: start coding up a simulation model for funsies. 

* `hastingsLab`: Skype meeting tomorrow to discuss ongoing work. 

* `helmCent`: push along
