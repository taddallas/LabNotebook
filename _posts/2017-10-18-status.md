## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects`: working through some more of the likelihood stuff. 

* `normalNiche`: pushed along manuscript writing. 
 
* `flourTest`: talked to Alan about habitat size stuff. I sensed vague interest. 

* `labLogistics`: setting deadlines on experiments, getting new folks up to speed, etc. 

* `jobApplication`: I applied to a job.

* `HMSC`: played around with some of the example code

* `reading` stuff and things (metapopulations, invasion fronts, etc.)





 
### Tonight 
 
* `dishes?`: If I have the energy, there is a large stack of lab dishes to do. 

* `run`

* `parasitePartition`: more thinking and maybe sketch out a conceptual skeleton of a thesis paragraph or methods section (putting pen to paper on ideas might help guide the project a bit).


 
 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `labLogistics`: push along data entry/validation. Lab organization and equipment ordering. Need to prep for two upcoming experiments. 


* `parasitePartition`: continue pushing along initial data formatting and such
