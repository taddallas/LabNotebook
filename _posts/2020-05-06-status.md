It's been about a month since my last update. Whooops.


## What have I worked on?

* `mothSync`: accepted for publication. hooray! :tada:

* `logistics`: so many of them. reviewed a couple manuscripts. handled one as editor. 

* `dispersalTrait`: back with minor revisions

* `priorityEffects`: finally completed big revisions (this project is from 2 years ago)

* `helmSubset`: pushed along model dev for this idea. I think it'll be neat.

* `inFocus`: wrote a bit of a In Focus piece for Journal of Animal Ecology

* `grantWriting`: using my wordy words.

* `otherStuff`: idk. It's been a month.



### Tonight

* `reproResearch`: course dev

* `run`: waiting until it cools off a bit.




## What should I be working on now?

* `helmSubset`: keep pushing this along

* `dispersalTrait` and `priorityEffects`: submit after co-author approval and small edits

* `takeStock`: no whiteboard at home, so keeping up with project status and such has been a bit more tough.
