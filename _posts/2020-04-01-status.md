## What have I worked on?

* `RCS`: It looks like it wasn't recommended for funding, which sucks. Hopefully I'll get some constructive feedback from it.

* `bioStability`: sketched out more of the general setup and the introductory text. Some stuff running on my home computer.

* `epiControl`: code cleaned up and ready to toss on figshare (couple of double-check analyses running on `beast2`).

* `rangeShape2`: responding to reviewer comments (some re-analyses running on `beast2`)



### Tonight

* `bike`

* `read`



## What should I be working on now?

* `bioStability`: generate some plots and identify the take-aways.

* `takeStock`: generate some new ideas and potential projects for the lab. I guess I should spend more time thinking about grants now, so do that too.
