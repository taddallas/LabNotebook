## What have I worked on?

* `checkerBoard`: desk reject from first journal for some reason related to a spatial storage effect that made no actual sense. submitted to second journal and got minor revisions and positive reviews. Sweeeeet. 

* `read`: good stuff

* `helmSize`: pushed forward a few revisions, but didn't do much honestly. 

* `abundOcc`: pushed along edits. Sent to Otso. He commented. I edited and pushed. Will send to Otso and Juha sometime today. 

* `rangeLean`: text dev. Passed to Robin. Progress was slow-going on this on my end. It's a good study, but lots of moving parts.

* `persistDistro`: pushed along development a bit. Mainly sketched out what I think are the hooks. 

* `gutInteract`: models finished training. Made some preliminary plots of omega matrices from models with and without random effects. Need to work on model performance scripts and think of more final figure layouts. 


* `hmscZoops`: meeting at 6pm. pushed along a bit of plotting of `hmscZoop2` before meeting, but may have to re-run models and save the model objects. The largest machine I can ssh into has 32gb memory. :/








### Tonight

* `persistDistro`: work on it.

* `run`: I got rained out yesterday, but we'll see if I can go for a little job today. 





## What should I be working on now?

* `checkerBoard`: work on revisions. 

* `hmscZoops`: pushing along temporal change component, and run aggregate model. 

* `persistDistro`: find the hook.

* `gutInteract`: explore the model output and think about compelling plots.
