## What have I worked on?

* `alandOcc`: separated this idea from `persistDistro2` (which may get abandoned). Some prelim code running now, and sketched out my ideas. 


* `bakeOff`: read through prediction scripts and made initial notes. Got the newest model fits folder and will work through the prediction code more thoroughly over the weekend or early next week. 


* `mothData`: sketched out some potential questions and read up on the data structure and what it's been use for. 


* `rangeVar`: read Gaston and McArdle 1994. Will check out more recent papers citing that soon, but damn they do a pretty good job sketching out the numerous limitations in examining temporal variability in species abundance.


* `labLogistics`: emailed with Joe at LSU about visit to Baton Rouge while I'm in New Orleans for ESA.

* `backup`: backed up flash drive. Eventually will figure out a better system, but for now, the occasional backup with `rsync` is what I got. Already have a NAS picked out for my lab at LSU. :)






### Tonight

* `kiasma`: modern art museum time. The general opinion of the place seems to be that some stuff is good, and some stuff is overly pretentious shit. 

* `beer`





## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeVar`: read up.

* `alandOcc`: push the plotting forward. Let's see what we got. 

* `bakeOff`: prediction scripts to check for errors.
