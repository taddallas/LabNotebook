## What have I worked on?

* `emergence`: pushed along some edits and made conceptual figure draft. 

* `persistDistro`: pushed along a bit conceptually. 

* `RECpresentation`: started sketching out presentation for next week. Deciding on what to present took half the time. 




### Tonight

* `read`



## What should I be working on now?

* `hmscMouse`: edit text and then share when ready (before next Friday probably)

* `professionalService`: review article

* `RECpresentation`: push along, as it'll help structure the introduction of the `persistDistro` work as well
