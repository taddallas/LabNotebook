## What have I worked on?

* `emergence`: wrote initial discussion and fixed up results a bit. I think it's a cool approach, but I'm really curious what others will think/if it's been done before and I'm just being silly. 

* `hmscMouse`: implemented both the Hmsc and HMSC (don't ask) approaches. Cleaned up code doc. Produced plots for meeting next week. 

* `closeEigen`: wrote initial function to calculate stats. Did some work on network simulation. Need to reel this project in before it gets crazy.

* `benSeminar`: Ben gave the eco-seminar today. It was good. 

* `abundanceSDM`: a few more minor edits. Need to decide whether to respond to reviewer's comments and re-submit, or look elsewhere. 

* `lterSeminar`: worked on organizing a seminar series for the fall. Invited one potential speaker. Need to provide progress update on Friday. 



### Tonight

* `run`

* `annaSDM`: go through rest of model code to provide feedback


## What should I be working on now?

* `closeEigen`, `nachoComment` and `persistDistro`

* `beer`: snag some cheap Lidl beer for Friday happy hour.
