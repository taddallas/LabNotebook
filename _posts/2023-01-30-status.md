## What have I worked on?

* `seminar`: Graduate researcher in the lab gave the dept seminar. Went really well! 

* `websiteDev`: week 2 of website development seminar I'm offering to interested folks. 15 or so folks. Good times. 

* `expenseReport`: uploading and justifying all lab expenses. Always fun. 

* `email`: everyone waits to send out emails until Monday, so Mondays are just a deluge of emails.

* `nihMira`: submitted supplemental info document before it goes into proper review. Fingers crossed on it, but it's a bit different than the backgrounds of folks on the review panel. Hopefully they'll see the value in what we do. 

* `remoteCode`: checked on some remote processes running on the high-memory machines. Fixed one small bug, but mostly just babysitting the code. 



### Tonight

* `bike`: maybe a structured workout if legs are up for it. 

* `theory`: read over Case chapter and figure out what goes in tomorrow's lecture versus Thursday. 




## What should I be working on now?

* `grants`: work on getting some moneys

* `computer`: lab computer random reboot issue not solved by BIOS update. If it does it again, going to remove and re-seat the processor with new thermal paste (is it a heat issue!?). Also will re-seat RAM and run with one stick for a bit to see if it solves it. Really frustrating and I can't seem to make heads or tails of the log files.
