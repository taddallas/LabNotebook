## What have I worked on?

* `hmscMouse`: re-worked a bunch of the organizational structure. Models still running, but manuscript is coming together.

* `persistDistro`: had an idea, but it might be shit. Laid down a bunch of code to test it, but it could be a wash (and a waste of half a day). 




### Tonight

* `takeStock`: update manuscripts.md file, and think about next steps on projects. 





## What should I be working on now?

* `nodeProperties`: finalize my side of edits and pass to collabs. 

* `professionalService`: review two articles

* `priorityEffects`: submit when Brett green lights it.

* `besMacro`: finalize poster and email Viia about printing
