## What have I worked on?

* `helmCent2` and `helmNAR`: writing and polishing. `helmCent2` sent to Pedro. `helmNAR` still in my hands for further polishing. 

* `logistics`: some lsuLogistics, some small updates to website/CV

* `courseMaterials`: worked a bit on course materials

* `read`: read some articles. Google Scholar is reCaptcha-ing me for some reason, which is really annoying. 






### Tonight

* `prepForREC`: RECteam meeting presentation. Give a quick update about Spain research. 





## What should I be working on now?

* `professionalService`: finish review?

* `otherStuff`
