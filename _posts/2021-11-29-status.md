## What have I worked on?



* `grantTransfer`: wrote all the necessary files except for the updated budget. Really hoping that our grants people do that bit. Fingers crossed hard on that one. 

* `facultyMeeting`: showed up

* `houseAppraisal`: did it

* `spectralCovid`: laid down some code for this, but it's too slow. Working on speeding it up and trying to find the elusive igraph memory leak (or what I think is an igraph memory leak)

* `logistics`: UofSC hire stuff, emails, etc.

* `swModScaling`: not all papers on sex work have to be about disease. Really annoying reviews from some pretty shortsighted people. 








### Tonight

* `bike`: need to get outside and run, but will likely just hop on bike trainer

* `pack`: 2 weeks to move

* `read`: some stuff for `nsfMacro`


## What should I be working on now?

* `mosquitoPartite`: where to next?

* `logistics`: moving and such is a pain.

* `nextSteps`: take stock of what's in review/revision and new projects
