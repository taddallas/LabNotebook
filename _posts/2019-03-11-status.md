## What have I worked on?

* `alandOcc`, `abundOcc`, `hmscMouse`: Helsinki projects that need to be pushed along.

* `helmBiogeog`: set up structure of the narrative and how the simulations fit with the empirical work.

* `helmCent`: this is two different projects, and I should have recognized that awhile ago. Worked a bit on separating and clarifying aims. 






### Tonight

* `helmCent`: continue the development of this as two related projects

* `groceries`, `read`, `sleep`: Sunday was a long day, and I'm still beat. 




## What should I be working on now?

* `atlanticNetworks`: Pedro's back so we'll probably meet for this soon. Have some initial simulations to show. 

* `helmBiogeog` and `helmCent`: push these along. Try to not focus on Helsinki projects while here in Spain. 

* `hmscMouse`: however, this Helsinki project has a resubmission deadline that is approaching. Push it along.
