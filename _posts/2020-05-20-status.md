## What have I worked on?

* `logistics`: my lab flooded so I've been "flooded" with paperwork and bullshit. See what I did there? 

* `mothSync` and `rangeShape2`: both accepted and at proofing stage. `mothSync` should be live fairly soon in PRSB. 

* `inFocus`: working on this with the help of some crazy smart students (at least one of them will be joining the lab in the fall, and I'd love for them both to join, but we'll see)

* `helmX`: got some logistical work ready for some of these to submit (cover letters written, code packaged up nicely, etc.). I will submit at least one of these soon. haha. 

* `verena`: some really cool stuff on the forefront that I am but a small player. More on that soon.

* `boughtHouse`: it's pretty sweet. 

* `carpentriesStuff`: I am now a Carpentries instructor (all the way through training and such). 




### Tonight

* `read`

* `takeStock`: where are we at with different projects and such

* `reproResearch`: some course dev. Lecture notes ready for like half the course. Once structure was put in place, the rest has come a bit easier. 



## What should I be working on now?

* `grantStuff`: money for students and lab fun. 

* `otherStuff`: I have some stuff written down in my actual lab notebook. Will think on it tonight.
