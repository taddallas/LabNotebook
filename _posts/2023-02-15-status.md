## What have I worked on?

* `UGinterview`: met with undergrad to talk about research opportunities in the lab

* `rViews`: discussed the idea/paper with Borregaard. 

* `grants`: some grant dev on an SEC travel grant and the BDHSC internal grant

* `magellan`: submitted two undergraduate researcher grants after co-developing some fun projects with them. Fingers crossed on both. 

* `theoryEcology`: some feedback to folks on their final projects. Some reviewing my notes for lecture tomorrow. 

* `amazon`: ordered the one last part for the shaker table build. Let's see if that works out for us. 



### Tonight

* `bike`: do the bike thing

* `read`: _Invading Ecological Networks_ is about half done. Super neat book.



## What should I be working on now?

* `theoryEcology`: teaching and final project pitches

* `nsfMacro`: meeting tomorrow afternoon. Push forward `neonTurnover` ideas in the morning, `neonVar` almost ready to re-submit

* `grantDev`: write some money words?

* `newIdeas`: think about current projects and conceptualize next step projects that fit in with proposed grant goals
