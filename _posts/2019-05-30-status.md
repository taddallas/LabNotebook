## What have I worked on?

* `helmBiogeog`: working with julia after not for awhile is difficult.

* `lsuLogistics`: some stuff

* `spectralSpread`: still running on rec machine. Did some writing though. 

* `rangeShape2`: fixed some of the code and lengthened timescale. Running sims again. 

* `rijekaTalk`: worked on getting seminar together for folks here. 

* `courseMaterials`: pushed a bit of the code lecture stuff along. I hope the students like this. 








### Tonight

* `courseMaterials`: push along the code lectures

* `takeStock`: so many projects nearly ready to submit but not in my hands. 




## What should I be working on now?

* `spectralSpread` and `rangeShape2` once they finish running.
