## What have I worked on?

* `epiControl`: re-running some of the simulations. 

* `hendrySeminar`: it was good

* `metacommunityClass`: talked chap 2. It was good. 

* `experimentalSystem`: sketched out some questions I'd like to ask with the experimental system.

* `labLogistics`: still trying to get the benchtops on the benches. Struggles.





### Tonight

* `epiControl`: Write some of the introduction

* `BoD-RCS`: keep pushing the grant along




## What should I be working on now?

* `BoD-RCS`: keep pushing the grant along

* `professionalService`: review
