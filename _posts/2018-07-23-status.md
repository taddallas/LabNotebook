## What have I worked on?

* `alandOcc`: pushed forward a bit, but there may be no story here. I think Hanski might have been spot on with regards to the importance of patch area. 

* `professionalService`: started article review

* `persistDistro2`: made some pretty plots. Sketched out some manuscript text. Waffled on which patches to include, so I made both sets of plots. Need to sit and think about this. 



### Tonight

* `takeStock`: sketch out some next steps and update project status document. 


## What should I be working on now?

* `professionalService`: finish off review

* `hmscMouse`: final read-through

* `mothQuestions`: sketch out.
