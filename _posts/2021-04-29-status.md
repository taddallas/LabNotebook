## What have I worked on?

* `mosquitoPartite`: pushed along the `mosquitoMagic`+`tripartite` merger. At least conceptually.

* `neonRicker`: code running and nearly done. Should be neato

* `grants`: developed some ideas and text for NIH R21 grant

* `manuscripts`: got `neonAO`, `spectralSpread`, ...  out of my hands. Need to get `rangeNiche` and `swModScaling` out of my hands soon.

* `uscTalk`: prepping some slides real quick for invited seminar


### Tonight

* `bike`: if knee isn't acting up

* `takeStock`: some projects need to get pushed along. identify which of those projects are on me and which are not.



## What should I be working on now?

* `professionalService`: review manuscript and stay on top of editorial stuff.

* `ongoingProjects`: `epiControl`, `neonRicker`, `swModScaling` are all in my hands. rapid projects like `parmTime` and `ageStructure` are also in my hands. 

* `newProjects`: within the constraints of existing grant funding, what are the next questions?
