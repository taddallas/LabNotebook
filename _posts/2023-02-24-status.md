## What have I worked on?

* `meetings`: lab meeting plus one-on-one meetings with all graduate researchers

* `labLogistics`: ordering some stuff, CV updates, added Bailey to lab website

* `neonTurnover`: pushed forward intro text and methods. Bit of results and the makings of a conceptual figure.



### Tonight

* `bike`: easy




## What should I be working on now?

* `sealant`: get tubeless setup for the gravel bike 

* `relax`: this week has been a bit long. Take time to recharge.
