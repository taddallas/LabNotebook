## What have I worked on?

* `eeidFish`: submitted last minute budget and mountain of paperwork to collaborators. From now on, I'm submitting a week early at least to avoid the stress and garbage. This one was sort of out of my hands.

* `logistics`: some lab logistics that needed to be taken care of. Getting on top of emails again took a bit of effort. Expense reports and other bs. 

* `odumSkype`: Skyped with a group of SDM folks at UGA to discuss joint SDMs. Good stuff.

* `grants`: pushed the text along on the grant I'm working on. Shaping up nicely. 




### Tonight

* `run`

* `grade`: exam 3 mostly done with grading, but going to hopefully finish it off tonight


## What should I be working on now?

* `epiControl` and `spectralSpread`: enough logistics! Do some science.

* `logistics`: ...

* `dispersalTrait`: edits 

* `grants`: keep slowly writing.
