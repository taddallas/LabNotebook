## What have I worked on?

* `hmscMouse`: added 2 tables and a figure, along with some explanatory text. Formatted the article for _JAE_, but it will likely go through some more edits and a friendly review round before submission. 


* `persistDistroX`: clearly delineated the proposed projects under this umbrella. README files are updated, and code is divided. Manuscripts now contain a more specific structure for each project. I have successfully disentangled the massive ball of yarn this project was becoming...I think. Pushed forward parts 0 and 2 a bit. 1 is still running on Jarno's machine. 







### Tonight


* `hmscZoop`: meeting at 5:30pm my time. 

* `run` and `read`




## What should I be working on now?

* `persistDistroX`: push along manuscript structure and outline plots and specific questions. 


* `kumpula`: at some point I should pick up the poster from the printer on Kumpula campus.
