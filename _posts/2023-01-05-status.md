## What have I worked on?

* `newYear`: Let this fall off because most of my life is writing grants for folks to reject and handling logistics of running a lab. It's a change, but I can't complain. At least for the start of the new year, I'll try to be more on this, as a means to hold myself accountable and track my time/effort a bit better than my current system. My last post was exactly 1 year ago. haha. 

* `theory`: teaching theoretical ecology. Worked on course notes and creating rubrics for homework assignments (done with hw 1 and 2, but 3 and 4 need work). 

* `neonRicker`: some simulation development. Most of the bottleneck is how long it takes the code to run. Dynamics on networks are not that easy to code up in R without being pretty slow. 

* `netScale`: some thinking on the project. It started good conceptually, but turned into a code hairball that is pretty much unrunnable in finite time. 

* `annualEval`: filled out departmental forms for annual evaluation. Going to talk to chair about mid-tenure review, as I've been here for 1 year, but was at LSU for 2. If I can get another grant, I'll be in decent shape. Good pub record, really great lab group, dev and taught 2 classes so far ... so I think I'm checking the right boxes. 

* `nsfCyber2`: received fairly positive comments on it, so working to incorporate reviewer comments and looking to re-submit it before too long. 



### Tonight

* `bike`: did 20+ gravel ride this morning, but might hop on the trainer to get more miles in. I'll stop being so slow if I get more miles in, right? Sold the old fixed gear (not my only fixed gear), and bought used Salsa Vaya for some fun gravel riding/bikepacking. 

* `read`: _Invading Ecological Networks_ book is calling my name. 




## What should I be working on now?

* `review`: agreed to review manuscript, so do it.

* `takeStock`: need to sketch out where projects stand and what I want to push forward/finish up/start in the new year/new semester.
