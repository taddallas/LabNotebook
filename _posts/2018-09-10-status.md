## What have I worked on?

* `hmscZoops2`: initial models done running. Good test of code and timing. Need to touch base with Drew on what the final models should look like, and about the many NaN values stemming from small data issues when bays dry down. 

* `abundanceSDM`: one small tweak to final proofs. Will be out soon in Early View. 

* `europaHPC`: submitted application. Fingers crossed.

* `alandOcc`: models done running. Plots produced for main analysis, but not variance inclusion. Make these before meeting next week (not a huge priority right now). 

* `gutInteract`: Cross-validation running now for model2. 

* `marjoLabMeeting`: 1:30pm. 

* `helmSize`: edits. Nearly complete and ready to send back in. Hopefully within the next couple of weeks. 



* `abundOcc`: some text edits to make sure methods is up-to-date

* `persistDistro`: consolidate repos and focused the project. Upon revisiting this, I think it's really neat, and will push it forward in the coming weeks. The temporal bit may take awhile, so I've moved it to a new repo with a different name. I'll read and think and this for a bit before attacking it again. 







### Tonight

* `read`: https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0169-5347%2818%2930186-1 and http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2018/02/12/1710352115.full.pdf

* `run`: outside until I'm forced inside. Picked up an old GPS watch for 20 euro, and it's been really fun to track pace.






## What should I be working on now?

* `persistDistro`: push it along. 

* `alandOcc`: have figures ready for meeting. So make the variability figures, and toss them in a different folder. Prepare a short little description of what I've done thus far for the meeting next week. 

* `rangeLean`: text dev. I am letting this one languish, and I don't know why.
