## What have I worked on?

* `grantStuff`: l o g i s t i c s 

* `labMeeting`, `harrisSeminar`, `harmanDefense`: lots of meetings. All really fantastic. 

* `helmSubset`: some rank correlation plots added, some text edits.

* `persistDistro`: reject from Am Nat. Incorporate comments and submit to Theoretical Ecology (Am Nat was a bit of a reach, but I think this is really neat stuff, and the editors agree...with some caveats)

* `otherStuff`: pushing this at 2:30pm so plenty of daylight left. 







### Tonight

* `run` and `read`: Stop being lazy and do some self care.

* `expenseReports`: the admin never ends.

* `otherStuff`?: idk. probably.








## What should I be working on now?

* `reproResearch`: finalize some of the assignments, and start to record lectures within a week or so to test how bad my webcam mic is. 


* `otherStuff`?
