## What have I worked on?

* `ecology`: worked on some lectures and edits to tests

* `meetings`: 4 hours of meetings today

* `tripartite`: I had previously included some gibberish variables. I've since removed those...but that means re-running everything. I am bad at science. Running on `beast2` currently. 

* `reading`: lots of reading. Mostly covid stuff. Some not.



### Tonight

* `bike`: hop on turbo for 1+ hours. Curious how long I could ride for continuously. May do 100+ soon just to see. 

* `read`




## What should I be working on now?

* `tripartite`, `parmTime`, `otherStuff`
