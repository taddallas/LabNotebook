## What have I worked on?

* `verena`: discussed some project ideas and logistic stuff

* `nsfMacro`: met with Lauren and Cleber about this project. Super cool stuff already starting to form here.

* `spaceTimeR`: one of the last weeks in the "everything spatio-temporal is best when Bayesian" class. 

* `reproResearch`: office hours and class

* `tripartite`: running on `beast2`

* `parmTime`: read to run on `beast1`, will be running by end of day if I can access the machine (vpn + lsu + wireless connection instead of ethernet = traaaaaaash). 





### Tonight

* `bike`: Trader Joe's. 

* `run`: around

* `prep`: long day tomorrow of meetings. Get prepped for lab meeting (i.e., journal club, plot for viz challenge, etc.) 




## What should I be working on now?

* `meetings`: lots of them

* `FYB`: ride bikes with kiddos in the afternoon. 

* `writing`: couple of projects could use some pushing along writing-wise.
