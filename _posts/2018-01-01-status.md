## What have I worked on?

* `professionalService`: reviewed article
 
* `UCLAtalk`: worked on invited talk to Lloyd-Smith and other interested labs

* `Finland`: paperwork, wiring money for rent, etc.

* `jobTalk`: I have an interview, so now I have a reason to push this forward. Got the skeleton worked up, but will look for feedback from Alan before I commit to this structure. 


 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* hit ground running after break. Push along `HMSC` stuff, get `checkerBoard` and `flatEarth` submitted, start piecing `jobTalk` together, etc.
