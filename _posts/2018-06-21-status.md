## What have I worked on?

* `emergence`: implemented null, and it's shit. Good.

* `persistDistro1`: laid down more simulation code and tossed it on one of Jarno's servers. This took most of the workday.

* `professionalService`: responded to question about `missingLinks` work from the PLoS Computational Biology paper that came out last year. Good to see folks are interested in it. 

* `ideas`: time to generate some new ideas for projects. Many old projects seem to be coming to a close, so I think I can shift my attention.



### Tonight

* `read`: Stochastic Communities: A Mathematical Theory of Biodiversity. Time to start this beast. 

* `ideas`: sketch out some more ideas, and take stock of the status of current projects. 



## What should I be working on now?

* `persistDistro`: both 1 and 2 need some tlc.

* `recProjects`: conceptualize projects specific to the goals of REC. Have a clear idea of which members would be interested in a given project, and outline projects that pull folks in.
