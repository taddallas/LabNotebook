## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects`: finished manuscript tweaks given new simulations. Some more model probing, but optimization seems pretty stable. 

* `hpNest`: preliminary figures and manuscript skeleton. Found a conceptual hook, now I just need to do the work. 

* `graphDissim`: started sketching out response to reviewers. Really solid reviews on this one, and I'm pretty stoked to see the finished product. 



### Tonight 

* `reading` and update white board 



## What should I be working on now? 


* `abundanceSDM`: in Easton's hands, but be ready to jump on his comments

* `graphDissim`: continue working on response to reviewers

* `nodeProperties`: respond to reviewers
