## What have I worked on?

* `spectralSpread`: pushed along the theoretical part a good bit, and dove into some analysis of empirical data. This has some promise. 

* `rangeShape3`: migrated over to Overleaf for dev. Looks alright, but pretty rough.

* `rangeShape2`: sims still running, and sucking down way too much memory. I blame the dispersal process and my garbage coding.

* `alandCrash`: Skype meeting to discuss manuscript

* `neutralNet`: sketched out conceptual idea. 







### Tonight

* `neutralNet`: sketch out some preliminary code. Annotate it well, since I'll have to make a bunch of design decisions early on and I might need to justify these. 

* `professionalService`: review 1 of 2 (push until tomorrow if too tired)



## What should I be working on now?

* `neutralNet`: push along.

* `spectralRadius`: if code finishes, push along. Otherwise, start the empirical sims on one of the `jarno` machines

* `otherStuff`
