## What have I worked on?
 
* `rangeLean`: made plots prettier. Added a couple of supplemental figures. It's taking shape. Need to incorporate data-model integration better, and incorporate discussion of dispersal in introduction and discussion. 

* `professionalService`: reviewed a manuscript

* `HMSCmouse`: pushed along some of the model training code to make sure the results are stable to training on data subsets and to see if model performance varies predictably with species traits. 






### Tonight 
 
* `read`: have a couple of articles in the backlog I've been meaning to read 

* `workout`: left stuff at home, but may be warm enough to run outside. 

* `helmSize`: add Shan's idea to the supplement. 




 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `HMSCmouse`: push along.
 
* `rangeLean`: start structuring the discussion, send a note to Robin to gauge input on the data-model integration. 

* `aland`: have some ideas sketched out, but need to read more and run them past someone smarter.
