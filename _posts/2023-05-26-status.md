## What have I worked on?

* `paraRando`: pushed forward idea after email back and forth with Dobson

* `neonTurnover`: incorporated feedback and nearly ready to submit

* `spectralSpread`: it literally sat in review at _Epidemics_ for 2 years. Got one review that was pretty dismissive and missed the point. So we're editing it and submitting elsewhere. Science is pretty dumb sometimes. 

* `grantStuff`: I probably worked on some grant stuff. Submitted `nsfCyber2` revision. Got a `t25` training grant from the Big Data Health Science Center, so that's neat. Contributed to an `r21` on some fun mosquito stuff. Internal center grant funded, so excited to do some more disease-y work with those folks. `nsfMacro` no cost extension submitted, but probably need to have a new grant in our lab to keep graduate researchers funded. 






### Tonight

* `fireflies`: minor league baseball game tonight



## What should I be working on now?

* `nextSteps`: what projects can I push forward related to grant aims? 

* `rangeNiche2`: write some text for this while the models run
