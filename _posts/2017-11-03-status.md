## What have I worked on?
 
* `flatEarth`: code nearly done. Changed manuscript text to make more targeted to the second 2 findings instead of the first, and to change article format. Took a bit of time.

* `labLogistics`: weekly update. Planning timing of future experiments and conclusion of ongoing ones. 

* `professionalService`: started working through review 

* `dietBreadth`: messed around with some old code looking for Taylor's law in parasites at large spatial scales. No evidence; polynomial fit was better than linear log-log fit. Thinking of other directions. 





### Tonight 
 
* `prosAndConsList`
 


 
 
## What should I be working on now? 

* `read`: most of my projects are out of my hands. Gives me time to read and think.

* `newProjects`: could be a bad idea to start new projects. Perhaps just organize projects and clear some of them off my desk?
