## What have I worked on?

* `r21`: aim development for some potential fun collaboration

* `theoryEcology`: more homework rubric work (this honestly took most of my time)

* `insectDisease`: actually fixed `getNCBI` function (not a hacky fix like I had before)

* `nsfCyber2`: some more dev, but it looks really good to me

* `laurenMeeting`: had one grad researcher meeting 



### Tonight

* `bike`: something spicy if up for it

* `nest`: maybe install the google nest thermostat. Weirdly excited about it. I am old now. 



## What should I be working on now?

* `theoryEcology`: course starts next week. Make sure everything is ready to roll.

* `websiteDev`: pick seminar time based on feedback. Reserve room and other logistics.
