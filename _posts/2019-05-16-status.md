## What have I worked on?

* `courseMaterials`: pushed this along in a big way

* `lsuLogistics`: some stuff

* `alandCrash`: fixed model performance measure and sent an email asserting that well-fitting models don't always tell you what you think they do. 






### Tonight

* `IDEAS`: take stock and think of the future






## What should I be working on now?

* `newProjects`: time to at least conceptualize some next steps that will relate to my longer term research plan at LSU.

* `rangeShapeX`: fix memory leak and start writing.

* `spectralSpread`: lay down some code and start exploring this idea. 





### Ideas for Croatian tourism advertisements

Croatia!
* Where pride in one's country doesn't have to be thinly-veiled xenophobia. 
* Our beaches and mountains are, like, walking distance from one another.
* Please don't call us Yugoslavia.
