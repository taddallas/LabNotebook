## What have I worked on?

* `makingThisEntry`: agreed to talk about my approach to science to Colin's lab group, and want this to look like I've updated it more frequently. haha

* `grantLogistics`: writing words to get moneys. 

* `helmNAR`: accepted at PRSB. dope.

* `reading`: so much reading.

* `tripartite`: got some data formatting and repo org done

* `officeHours`: biol 4253 office hours. 

* `priorityEffects`: it's so close to being in JAE. *fingers crossed* ... this experiment was run over 2 years ago.






### Tonight

* `neonAO`: review and suggest some changes before we send this out the door.

* `bike`: try to read articles while on the bike and see how much it sucks?





## What should I be working on now?

* `helmCent2`: due to Phil Trans by March 15. 

* `Verena`: huddle on Friday, prep 3 slides (maybe encourage Lauren to prep 3 for `helmVirus`?)

* `grantStuff`: push forward some of that text. 

* `otherStuff`: logistics (e.g., start writing Jason's quals questions, etc.)
