## What have I worked on?

* `rangeNiche1`: filled out discussion, added one more plot, and wrote abstract. Needs more polishing though. 

* `sevilla`: some ideas sketched out in a bit more detail. 

* `rangeShape2`: invited to submit abstract for special issue on abundant-centre. Sketched out some ideas, but may not follow through. 

* `tookStock`: sketched out progress on each ongoing project. 

* `residencePermit`: extended my Finnish residence permit. Easy process with friendly people. Also signed up for online banking. I'M AN ADULT!





### Tonight

* `run` and `groceries`







## What should I be working on now?

* `emergence`: toss null out the window and sharpen the text.

* `sevilla`: further solidify main protocol and potential side ideas. Set up repo structure and start organizing the data. 

* `newProjects`: time to think of new project ideas and next steps.
