## What have I worked on?
 
* `flatEarth`: pushed along reviewer responses. Working on details, but will get models running shortly. 

* `priorityEffects`: tiny tweaks to manuscript text. 

* `metacom`: small patch

* `rangeLean`: discussed the project with Robin. Outlined a couple of model-data integration plots we'd like to push along. She's tackling some code updates. I'm in charge of manuscript framing and some plotting eventually. 




### Tonight

* `normalNiche`: push manuscript skeleton forward, complete with some citations to the relevant literature on this topic. 

* `helmSize`: Provide a bit more proposed skeleton to discussion and email collaborators to see what their collective plan is. 

* `emergence`: reading




## What should I be working on now? 


* `labLogistics`: undergrad interviews Wednesday afternoon. 

* `emergence`: if it reads right, implement their method and push this forward.
