## What have I worked on?

* `emergence`: submitted

* `abundanceSDM`: addressed reviewer concerns. Will submit as a revised manuscript shortly. 

* `OtsoMeeting`: discussed research ideas related to the `hmscMouse` project. Gave some helpful advice with respect to determining the role of mixing. Worked towards implementing this advice. 

* `dallasLab`: set up lab Github organization. I know it's early, but whatever.




### Tonight

* `macroHelminth`: address reviewer comments

* `abundanceSDM`: finishing touches and pass to Alan for approval



## What should I be working on now?

* `professionalService`: knock out at least one of the reviews.

* `helmSize`: let this slip through the cracks. Need to re-familiarize and finish the edits. 

* `persistDistro`: write introduction and clear thesis paragraph!
