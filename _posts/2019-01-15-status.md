## What have I worked on?

* `hmscMouse`: still training models in hopes that I can debug the shit prediction code. The R6 class is a bit frustrating.

* `alandOcc`: final models trained, plots re-made. 

* `professionalService`: I agreed to another one from the same journal. bonus points?

* `sevilla`: pushed along one interesting conceptual angle that I need to think more about. 

* `mothSync`: laid down some code and made some pretty plots. Need to think about negative weights and if I've incorporated them correctly. 







### Tonight

* `pack`






## What should I be working on now?

* `professionalSevice`

* `labPresentation`: put together presentation for Marjo's lab meeting on Sevilla plans

* `mothSync`: make the thesis more concrete and decide on final analytic approach.

* `alandOcc`: writing and everything needs to be bombproof by next week (meeting on Jan 21).
