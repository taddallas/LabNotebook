## What have I worked on?


* `helmCent1`: separated in concept and analysis from another project (reproduction by budding). Analysis complete. Pretty plots made, and nearly ready to share with Pedro for comments.

* `helmCent2`: coming along slightly more slowly, but at least part of the analysis is done. Needs more thinking about the phase space issue and the utility of classification for species roles.

* `lsuLogistics`: 16k in renovations planned (2x more than the only car I've ever owned costed). oof. Also ordered computer and desk stuff for when I arrive, but funds won't be open for other purchases until July. 

* `atlanticNetwork`: some simulation code pushed. Should come in handy once we have a clearer idea of project scope and data availability. 

* `alandOcc`: rejected from PRSB. Reviews all positive. I'll address reviewer concerns and submit elsewhere soon. 

* `seminar`: I signed up to present on March 28. Did some initial sketching out of talk structure. 





### Tonight

* `professionalService`: was asked to review 3 articles. I agreed to 2. Now I need to do the reviews (tonight + this weekend)

* `helmNar`: start pushing forward the writing. Analyses are still running, but should be done in the next week or two. 



## What should I be working on now?

* `hastingsLab`: couple of lingering projects in revision or needing to be submitted. 

* `longRun`: get out and see more of Seville via running.
