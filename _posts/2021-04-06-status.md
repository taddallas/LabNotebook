## What have I worked on?

* `philTrans`: special issue stuff. Pretty positive reviews all around. Still waiting for reviews on the one I'm first author on. 

* `neonRicker`: some simulations finished running. Did some exploration, but needs more.

* `trumanSeminar`: gave a talk at my UG institution (virtual)

* `tripartite`: did some thinking on it

* `otherStuff`: idk, it's been awhile. Probably some logistics. e-mail, e-mail, e-mail.



### Tonight

* `groceries`: need to go shopping

* `run`: been getting too lazy on the bike, need to get back into running

* `nsfRapid`: push along the idea Bret and I discussed





## What should I be working on now?

* `neonRicker`: further exploration
* `nsfRapid`: push forward the idea. Do some reading around the idea.
* `otherStuff`: idk. Take stock and figure out what needs to get pushed forward most.
