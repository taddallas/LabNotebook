## What have I worked on?

* `helmCent1`: text pushed along a lot.

* `logistics`: setting up `beast` and trying to get wifi through concrete, finalized test dev for biol4253, got access to campus vehicles, re-did my stupid grant budget because dumbdumbdumbdumb, etc.

* `eeidGrant`: discussed my contribution to a NSF-EEID grant proposal. It sounds neat.

* `mothSync`: edits complete. Passed to collabs.

* `postdocTalk`: met with graduate student to chat about postdocs

* `seminar`: natural science musuem

* `homeDepotOrder`: I need whiteboards, and for some reason they can't deliver because they "couldn't find" the large state school located in the same town as them. 




### Tonight

* `grant`: formalize your macrosystems idea





## What should I be working on now?

* start getting `helmX` projects out the door.

* `takeStock`: some manuscripts donezo, others in review, some gathering dust. Sketch out where projects are.

* `otherStuff`?
