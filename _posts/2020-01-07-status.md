## What have I worked on?

* `helmX`: updates to all `helm` projects, so 3 in total.

* `reading`: read 3-4 papers and came up with a couple of potential project ideas. Some of these involved some silly Google searches.

* `logistics`: a bit more logistics around the lab, and some chatting with colleagues about possible 'data science' type brown bag lunch group. 

* `professionalService`: reviewed one manuscript





### Tonight

* `run`

* `read`



## What should I be working on now?

* `helmX`: get Pedro to sign off on these for submission.

* `cleber`: meet to discuss the lab, some ideas, and dept-level logistical stuff

* `professionalService`: review the _other_ manuscript

* `newProjects` and `takeStock`
