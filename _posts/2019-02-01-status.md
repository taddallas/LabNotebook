## What have I worked on?

* `mothSync`: pushed forward a bit 

* `mothSim`: changed the similarity measure and thought about conceptual flow of project

* `helmCent`: laid some code down and got stuff running. 

* `hpc`: played around with the cluster. It has no way to download R packages (you can scp things to the cluster though), so I'm trying to think of the best way to handle package dependencies. Docker is out, sadly. It's either I scp/rsync all my packages to the cluster, or I snipe specific functionality needed from packages and include it in some support functions script near the top of my job submission file.

* `professionalService`: agreed to review another paper. Project for this weekend maybe?





### Tonight

* `run`: first run in Sevilla. I've walked a lot, but I think I know my way around enough to run and not get lost. We shall see. 






## What should I be working on now?

* `helmX`: push along these projects in concept

* `mothSim` and `mothSync`: solidify goals of these and start sketching out methods and intro skeleton.
