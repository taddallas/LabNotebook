## What have I worked on?

* `nsfCareer`: uploaded to research.gov with budget and all the forms and so many forms and more forms
* `nsfMacro`: annual report submitted. More forms. Plus weekly meeting to discuss progress.
* `ecosphere`: handling editor duties 
* `defense`: Kristiaan defended dissertation. Good stuff. 
* `paraRando`: pushed forward somewhat, but feeling a bit stalled on it.
* `logistics`: sent some emails, responded to some emails, you know how it goes.



### Tonight

* `bike`: have not worked out since helping my parents move and being exposed to so many germs from nieces. 


## What should I be working on now?

* `grants`: more grant dev and tweaking. Many thanks to some really helpful folks. Need to edit accordingly. 

* `takeStock`: make sure projects page is updated and think about next steps as they relate to grants and folks in the lab. Would be cool to get some funding, but annoying to have to select projects based on grants and not just on a whim.
