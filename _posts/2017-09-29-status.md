## What have I worked on?

* `beetleExperiment`: _T. madens_ time to shine. Contacted Campbell to see if _T. brevicornis_ is still being maintained. Started sketching out some experimental ideas.

* `andersonAward`: 5 page _statement of achievement_ 

* `labLogistics`: incubator acting up. Calibration doesn't seem to fix the issue. 

* `normalNiche`: found my knowledge gap. Pushing forward on this. Jotted down a bit more structure to the thesis paragraph, but plenty of details need to be filled in. 




### Tonight 

* `party`: It's my birthday and I plan on playing soccer with my goddaughter, grilling up some veggies, and having a few beers.






## What should I be working on now? 


* `hpNest`: think.
  
* `graphDissim`: respond to reviewers
