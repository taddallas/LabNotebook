## What have I worked on?

It's been a little bit since last update. Coming back from Spain involved passing some projects to Pedro, and picking up neglected projects here in Helsinki. I am also homeless currently. 

* `hsmcMouse`: Models finally done. Finishing touches made. Passed to collaborators for comments and approval.

* `logistics`: moving + teaching + setting lab up remotely (this actually takes a bit of time!). 

* `alandCrash`: made a quick dumb plot! Discussed some stuff with Aapo. Then some with Erik.

* `atlanticNetworks`: pushed along network simulation code. Implemented a few different probabilistic extinction scenarios. Code looks pretty.







### Tonight

* `courseMaterials`: keep working on course notes for LSU.

* `otherStuff`






## What should I be working on now?

* `hmscMouse`: get it re-submitted

* `mothSync` and `persistDistro`: go over with Otso and incorporate his comments.
