## What have I worked on?

* `metacom`: minor tweak to package. Pushed changes to Github and CRAN update submitted. If I could donate money/coffee/beer directly to the R Core team (except maybe Ripley), I'd do it in a heartbeat.

* `alandOcc`: models running. I'm hopeful that something comes out as interesting. It would be sort of a neat story if colonization/extinction processes were predicted by different variables than persistence time. It would indicate a separation of process for species getting to a place and species staying in a place. 

* `abundOcc`: further manuscript edits. Discussion is still lacking, but want to get feedback on scope and such before I push that forward. 

* `hmscMouse`: edits completed. Message sharpened, especially in abstract and introduction. 

* `awesome`:  It's a tiling window manager and desktop environment. Was using i3 for awhile, but the learning curve was a bit steep, and it requires too much upfront knowledge and tweaking (network-manager, etc.). I'm really liking awesome thus far.

* `ypj`: filled out performance plan (internal logistic stuff). 

* `rangeLean`: hitting bug. Emailed Robin about it, since I think it relates to the C code. She wrote it, and is a badass.



### Tonight

* `workout` and `sleep`: still a bit jet-lagged, and not feeling the greatest. Will drink lots of green tea, workout, and get a good nights sleep (hopefully). 




## What should I be working on now?

* `helmSize`: push the edits forward.

* `persistDistro0`: needed to run a subset of the models again, but the results on the larger networks look pretty neat.
