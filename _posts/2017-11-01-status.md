## What have I worked on?
 
* `interview`: It went pretty well. Intimidating to speaking to 5 great scientists at once.
 
* `flourTest`: some gen 3 data entry. May come in later tonight and hammer out some more.

* `read`: Read some range shift papers.

* `priorityEffects`: figured out a way to better present coexistence portion. Pushed along lots and lots of code changes. Code reads better, and I feel good about the changes. 





### Tonight 
 
* `takeStock`: spent most of last night last minute prepping for interview and reading _Here I am_ to de-stress. Highlight some areas where things can be pushed forward, and update project statuses on whiteboard.
 
* `priorityEffects`: update manuscript text with new sweet plots




## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `flourTest`: more data entry and validation

* `flatEarth`: text edits
