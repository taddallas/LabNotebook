## What have I worked on?

 
* `nodeProperties`: outlined reviewer concerns and passed to coauthors to see what their opinions are. Listening to calming music so I don't get too upset about personal attacks in the reviews. As a reviewer, it's your job to assess the quality of the work standing on it's own. Don't compare it to my previous work, and don't tell me that you're "disappointed" in my current work. Your disappointment is not constructive feedback, and the quality of my previous work has nothing to do with the content of the manuscript you're reviewing. Rant over.


* `graphDissim`: continued to sketch out responses to reviewers (these reviewers were fantastic). Passed along to Tim. Meeting with him sometime next week to chat about how to proceed. 



* `macroHelminth`: RCN meeting in 19 days, so I'm pre-emptively updating some projects that have been limping along. Cleaned up with some text edits and formatting. Re-wrote much of the discussion section. I think this is looking really great. At least as good as my previous research.





### Tonight 

* `run`: if time permits, plan to go for a quick jog. 







## What should I be working on now? 

* `helmSize`: work on edits before RCN meeting. Maybe email Ignacio to see which sections he'll be focusing on. 

* `graphDissim`: read up on ways to incorporate reviewer-suggested changes.

* `normalNiche`: sketch out some manuscript text while David ponders the bivariate fitting stuff. 

* `dispersalTrait`: edit prior to passing to team for comments.
