## What have I worked on?

* `hmscMouse`: touched base with Otso on manuscript. Will discuss model structure tomorrow.

* `persistDistro`: ambiguously defined project that could take at least 5 different paths. Sketched out potential protocols, and will solicit opinions from Otso soon. 

* `flatEarth`: formatted and submitted. 

* `rangeShape`: finalized reply to comment and passed it to Alan before submission. 

* `emergence`: final touches to code and text. Added conceptual figure. Figured out data release issues. 



### Tonight

* `reviews`: agreed to two reviews, so I need to start pushing those along

* `run`: it's been too long. Time to hit the trails.

* `emergence`: submit as pre-print, and submit to journal. 




## What should I be working on now?

* `otsoMeeting`: talk to Otso.

* Been tired and unfocused as of late. Need to get on proper sleep schedule and try to push myself back into work mode. 

* `persistDistro`: push it along!

* `hmscMouse`: adjust given feedback from Otso. Sharpen/edit the text, and provide more detail on the HMSC methods section.
