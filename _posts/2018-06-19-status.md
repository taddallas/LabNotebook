## What have I worked on?

* `esaLogistics`: all worked out. 18 hour total flight with 2 connections, but I WILL BE THERE!!! 

* `nodeProperties`: finalized responses and edits. Passed to collaborators for green light. Wrote draft cover letter. 

* `persistDistro1`: got potentially bad idea running code-wise. Need to shift focus to `persistDistro2` protocol, structure, and code. 


* `hmscMouse`: fixed a few small labeling issues and minor text edits given Otso's feedback.


* `professionalService`: completed the last of the reviews. Hopefully there is a small break before I get asked again.


* `besMacro`: poster order placed. 


* `WOSfail`: BioScience article proofs. 






### Tonight

* `persistDistro2`: work on it

* `ideaFormation`: Aland ideas as well sketching out some low-hanging fruit projects. 




## What should I be working on now?

* `ideas`

* `hmscMouse`: finalize

* `macroHelminth` and `nodeProperties`: get revisions back soon-ish.
