## What have I worked on?


* `helmCent`: some data changes, so I have to re-run the analyses (currently on `rec` machine). Currently running. Manuscript text is coming along. Needs results and discussion, plus supplemental materials. 

* `bakeOff`: Anna's paper was accepted, so get ready! It's a monograph that surveys the currently available JSDMs and their relative performance.

* `helmNAR`: re-running because of the same data changes that affected `helmCent` (currently on `bsc` machine)

* `helmBiogeog`: some introduction work and lots of reading. The analysis is done. Made some decent plots. This is a fun one. 






### Tonight

* `runningGroup`: easy way to get exercise and meet people outside of science.

* `read`: 1Q84





## What should I be working on now?

* `hastingsLab`: meeting next week, so need to be able to update on `priorityEffects`, `checkerBoard2`, and `dispersalTrait`

* `helmX`: keep pushing on.
