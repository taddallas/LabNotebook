## What have I worked on?

* `priorityEffects`: thought I submitted it. I did not. Hit submit button today.

* `aleksiTalk`: talk on bird distributions and climate change. 

* `rangeNiche`: pushed code forward a great deal. Some interesting results, but need to think about this more. A bit of writing, but mainly setting up the structure. 

* `csc-taito`: HPC access. Signed up just in case I have a project in the near future that would require these resources. Job submission is a bit clunky, but the resources are free (up to 10,000 "units", which I imagine is CPU hours?). Ran an initial test submission. Everything came up fine. 




### Tonight

* `pack`



## What should I be working on now?

* `persistDistro`, `alandOcc`, `rangeNiche`, etc.
