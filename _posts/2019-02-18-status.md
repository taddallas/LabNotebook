## What have I worked on?

* `helmCent`: laid down a bit of code for an additional analysis that should compliment the main nicely. Also refined and re-wrote some of the introduction I had, and expanded on the methods section. 

* `helmNAR`: separated this project from `helmNets` and provided a good outline for the intro structure. Fleshed out the methods section a bit, but it could change. Code still running on `rec` machine. 




### Tonight

* `thisPost`: it is night as I write this

* `takeStock`: respond to a couple emails, assess where projects are at

* `helmCent`: conceptual figure creation

* `read`: 1Q84 




## What should I be working on now?

* `helmCent`: push it along. Dive deeper into the odd ?host bug.

* `helmBiogeog`: some analysis and plotting 

* `helmNAR`: largely waiting on the max code, but other analyses can also be started now that are more in line with the original idea behind `helmNets`
