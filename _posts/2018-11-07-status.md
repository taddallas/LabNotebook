## What have I worked on?

* `lterCourse`: hosting Amanda Bates, discussion with students tomorrow

* `missingLinks2`: variable importance code running. Make figures next. Refresh this. 

* `gutInteract`: re-running models with longer chains and more chains to get ready to make final-ish figures.

* `comStability`: discussed the project a bit with Amanda and Laura. 

* `rangeNiche`: this project has two diverging paths. Set up separate repos for them and will push along first idea, while maybe laying some conceptual code down for second soon.



### Tonight

* `logistics`: think about longer term stuff. Spain. After.



## What should I be working on now?

* `missingLinks2`: writing and thinking

* `emergence`: check on null results and discuss with coauthors
