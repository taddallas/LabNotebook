## What have I worked on?

* `recPresentation`: went alright, but I could've included a bit more background. 

* `hmscMouse`: added citations and context. Structured nicely. Need to pick a target journal and format it. Pushed along solidly though. 




### Tonight

* `recBeers`: after work beers. 

* `run`: run after beers. It will be a slow run. 



## What should I be working on now?

* `hmscMouse`: pass to collaborators and ask for comments.

* `persistDistro`: push along conceptually. Discuss results and next steps with Otso soon. 

* `nodeProperties` and `macroHelminth` minor revisions! (exciting)
