## What have I worked on?
 
* `emergence`: pushed along some figure creation, mostly stemming from Colin's ideas about differential predictive ability.

* `normalNiche`: checked out code. Still one conceptual disconnect. Contacted Dave about this. 

* `read`: read and think and read some more. 

* `HMSC`: more exploration into the codebase.



 
 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `normalNiche`: figure out disconnect 
 
* `flatEarth`: models nearly done running (ran into some issues previously). Get ready to re-make plots and tweak text.

* `scramble`: still unsure best way to approach model of this. Read more and think about it.
