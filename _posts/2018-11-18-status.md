## What have I worked on?

slow week. some stuff got done though.

* `hmscMouse`: newly implemented conditional predictions. Discussed responses to reviewers with Otso, and pushed along the re-training of the models to satisfy the reviewers' concerns. 


* `alandOcc`: got comments from Torsti and pushed along the edits. Nearly ready for submission.


* `abundOcc`: finalized and passed to collaborators for final comments


* `rangeNiche1`: laid down some good code and pushed forward pretty solidly. Nearly ready to show people to see what they think.


* `missingLinks2`: new and improved variable importance measure implemented. Some first pass plots made, but still need to sharpen the hook. 


* `voleIdeas`: sketched out one promising vole idea and passed to Otso Huitu.




### Tonight

* `run`: only third time this week, which is my limit of clean running clothes without doing laundry. 

* `laundry`: see point above.





## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeNicheX`: it's exciting and can be pushed along without any impediments (hopefully)

* `missingLinks2`: get it to a point where you can rope John in on it to get his opinion.
