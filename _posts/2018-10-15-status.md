## What have I worked on?

* `professionalService`: review completed

* `marjoLabMeeting`: good stuff

* `helmSize`: responded to reviewer's concerns (minor revisions)

* `recovery`: was in the US for 2 weeks for RCN, co-teaching marine ecology course, visiting brother, and going to friend's wedding. I am jetlagged and spent most of the day getting on top of emails and chugging coffee. I also slept for 16 hours last night. I may be broken.





### Tonight

* `lsuLogistics`: e-mail check in and update them with biosafety cabinet info

* `gitPrez`: agreed to give a quick git/Github workshop for Marjo's group next week. Sketch out what I think it should cover, and how best to balance teaching version control versus showcasing the web interface of Github. I have about 30 minutes to present this. 







## What should I be working on now?

* `emergence`: revisions to the manuscript one reviewer said was "not publishable in any journal". We think the reviewer may be incorrect.

* `persistDistro`: writing

* `alandOcc`: writing

* `recMeeting`: slides for Oystein, slides for REC group to Malcolm.
