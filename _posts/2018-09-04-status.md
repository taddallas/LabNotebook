## What have I worked on?

(for the past week or so)

* `alandOcc`: prepped seminar for Friday and pushed along analysis and manuscript

* `manuscriptLogistics`: more stuff for proofs for `macroHelminth` and `abundanceSDM`

* `checkerBoard` and `dispersalTrait`: submitted

* `europaApp`: contacted host and pushed forward application for funding

* `abundOcc`: shifted variance stuff to supplement and re-structured stuff




### Tonight

* `read` and `think`

* `run`: if it's not too chilly/rainy

* `persistDistro`: pivot. The dynamical measure of metapopulations I was using went boooooonk. 




## What should I be working on now?

* `helmSize`: revisions

* `hmscMouse`: submit soon-ish

* `abundOcc`: push it forward
