## What have I worked on?
 
* `andersonAward`: edits to statement, but still may be a bit _laundry-list-y_
  
* `abundanceSDM`: polishing edits and passed to Alan for green light

* `graphDissim`: responded to reviewers, but need to run some supplemental analyses on home computer.

* `normalNiche`: word writing. Start framing conceptual disconnect, citing appropriate literature on both sides. Pretty slow going.




### Tonight 

* `adminStuff`

* `hpNest`: think about main message and meta-narrative.

* `run`


## What should I be working on now? 

* `normalNiche`, `graphDissim`, 

* `beetleMeeting`: tomorrow. Make sure `priorityEffects` edits are all incorporated. 

* other stuff.
