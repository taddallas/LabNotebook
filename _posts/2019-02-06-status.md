## What have I worked on?

* `helmX`: spent a bit of time standardizing I organize and store the LNHM data. 

* `helmNets`: laid down code for net stat calculations. 

* `helmCent`: tweaked how I standardized centrality, and filtered data based on a couple of conditions to pre-bloat the supplement with things I know reviewer's will ask for/criticize. Runnnig on 48 cores currently. Sketched out skeletal introduction. Tiny bit of methods dev.

* `NAR`: got some initial code running on 20 cores of the rec machine. Looks better than it did when I accidentally took up 70g of RAM with some error-ridden code earlier today.





### Tonight

* `mothSync` or `mothSim`: do some stuff here.

* `run`: finally getting over a small bug, so I'll go out for an easy run this evening. 




## What should I be working on now?

* `helmX`: push these along so I have something in hand by the time I leave Spain.

* `NAR`: think more about this.
