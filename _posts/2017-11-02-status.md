## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects`: worked new figures into text and updated all text. Need to read it through to make sure everything flows nicely, but I think this edit makes more sense than how we had it. 
 

* `CPBnomination`: Trying to become a more official part of the _Center for Population Biology_. 

* `reading`: Boettiger's noise/stochasticity review 

* `jobStuff` 

* `popBioSeminar`



### Tonight 
 
* `professionalService`: give paper a solid read-through. 
 
* `run` 
 


 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `professionalService`: complete review before end of weekend

* `flourTest`: data entry and validation
