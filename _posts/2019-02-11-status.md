## What have I worked on?

* `helmCent`: wrote much of introduction. Got some code running, but it's taking lots of time and I'm burning through my CPU hour allotment too fast if I keep this pace. 

* `helmNets`: the playNAR code runs, but there's a memory leak somewhere that I can't put my finger on. Currently running one simulation run and it's sucking down 40-50gb. Makes no sense. Going to see if it's just the modularity part that's the cause, then consider cutting or refining it to get rid of leak. 

* `checkerBoard2`: reject and re-submit with really positive comments. I really wish they'd call it something different, because this honestly looks more like minor revisions to me. 


* `reading`: a few papers, including a community trajectory paper in _Eco Monographs_ from De Caceres and folks that I'd been meaning to read for a bit. 






### Tonight

* `logistics`: some bs with my Finnish bank and my inability to use my card for the next 10 weeks.

* `checkerBoard2`: sketch out plan for revisions

* `mothSync`: push along conceptually, and make plot of spatial graph with nodes colored by mean cor and node size proportional to sd corr (or maybe species richness should be point size?). 

* `helmBiogeog`: get geographic coordinates and area. 






## What should I be working on now?

* `helmNets`: get overall net code running on jarno12 once R is updated there. This will get around time limitations and provide some nice sandboxing before I toss similar stuff on mareNostrum (Barcelona cluster). 


* `helmCent`: make sure code is producing some sort of output. By tomorrow it should've it one of the checkpoints in the code.
