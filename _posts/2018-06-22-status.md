## What have I worked on?

* `lsuLogistics`: filled out form and sketched out plan for lab renovations. 

* `macroHelminth`: submitted revisions.

* `read`: a few articles. 



### Tonight

* `workout`: abs and plyometrics, since it is rainy and gross. 



## What should I be working on now?

* `statusUpdate`: update manuscripts.md file and take stock of where things are.

* `newProjects`: keep thinking. Where do I want my research program to go, and how does it fit into the goals of REC?
