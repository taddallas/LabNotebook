## What have I worked on?

* `logistics`: for moving. Roof repair scheduling, some packing, other garbo

* `teaching`: exam 4 created

* `seminar`: attended U of SC seminar

* `grant`: some writing and forms and such

* `networks`: started playing around with another network idea, but long ways to go on that.





## What should I be working on now?

* `VerenaMeeting`: meet with Colin tomorrow 

* `teaching`: final project day (go early and make sure audio/video work for hybrid teaching)

* `packingAndShit`: moving is stupid
