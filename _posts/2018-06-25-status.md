## What have I worked on?

* `aland`: idea formation and general exploration. 

* `helminthLDR`: nascent collab with Colin. Data processed. Sent message to Colin with a few possible analytical options. Will push along tonight when he probably gets back to me. 

* `hmscMouse`: Anna-Liisa provided some comments. I worked on incorporating them. 

* `persistDistro`: laid down some code for the first project, and Jarno's machine is still chugging through code for the second. Hit a small bug I can't seem to diagnose, but ran diagnostics. Will know more tomorrow, hopefully. 




### Tonight

* `helminthLDR`: flesh out directory structure and re-make/tweak plots. 




## What should I be working on now?

* `persistDistro`: push this stuff along.

* `hsmcMouse`: go over the manuscript text to provide more detailed edits and incorporate more of the evolutionary angle Anna-Liisa referred to.
