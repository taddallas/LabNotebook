## What have I worked on?

* `insectDisease`: worked towards resubmission on this. Got Zenodo integration, etc.

* `neonRicker`: submitted it

* `grantLogistics`: changing universities is annoying sometimes. So is updating current and pending support forms. Grant stuff in general is a bit extra.

* `professionalService`: agreed to review grant and finished review of article. 

* `rangeNiche`: every time I do GIS in R, I have to re-learn it all. It's awful. Every. Time. 





### Tonight

* `ride`: indoor bike. Need to get back out running, but bruised ribs hurt bit too much. 





## What should I be working on now?

* `grantWriting` 

* `campusShit`: logistics, get some code running on lab machines, continue unpacking, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.
