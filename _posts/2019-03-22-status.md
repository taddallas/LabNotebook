## What have I worked on?

* `abundOcc`: finishing touches on edits. Sent back to collaborators for comments. 

* `alandOcc`: will wait until next week to submit to give collaborators more time to comment. I think it looks solid though. 

* `rangeNiche1`: Laura commented, so tried to clarify. Worked on narrative, which is tough in macroecological studies, as lots of disparate threads all worthy of discussion make the intro and discussion a jumbled knot. 

* `mothSync`: email sent, cover letter drafted, and minor manuscript tweaks. 






### Tonight

* `run`, `tapas`, `packForGranada`

* `helminthPres`: maybe start working on it?



## What should I be working on now?

* `helminthPres`: probably should work on it.

* `hastingsLab`: slowly finishing up these projects.
