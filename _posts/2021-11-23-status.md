## What have I worked on?

Starting this back up. It'll probably falter with the holidays, but whatever. Worth a shot. I'll just skip what I've been up to, and focus on current and ongoing projects

* `grants`: loads of grant writing. Had one rejection from NIH. Meanies. Put together some internal U of SC funding request and then NSF

* `neonRicker`: pushed this forward a bit. Good to have time to do science. 

* `randomLogistics`: this is most of my life.



## What should I be working on now?

* `grants`: keep pushing 

* `takeStock`: packing, logistics, project dev, longer-term vision, etc.
