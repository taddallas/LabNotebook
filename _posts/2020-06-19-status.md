## What have I worked on?

* `sDiv`: not funded. One garbage reviewer, but it's alright. Some really supportive (potential) group members

* `rangeNiche`: manuscript rejected with good comments. They really wanted a null model incorporated. I pushed back a bit against it, opting for a different route. They were unconvinced. I'll pass elsewhere after I incorporate the null (maybe. still not really convinced it tells us anything useful). 

* `persistDistro`: reject after 2 rounds of revision from Am Nat. Understandable, and editors notes were pretty positive. Need to sit and think about it a bit and then maybe pass to Theoretical Ecology or something similar


So lots of rejections. This is the process. Not going to let it get me down. It is worth noting though that science will not be inclusive until the comments I received on that sDiv grant don't exist. Receiving those as a person who already felt out of place in science would be brutal. Fuck that reviewer. 


* `neonEFI`: on a call this week about forecasting community ecology measures. Really interesting and thought-provoking.

* `verena`: VERENA folks are awesome. So many good conversations. Developed a forward facing dynamic repo to highlight which host-betacoronavirus associations are predicted given our models, updated as data changes. 


* `logistics`: reading, grant stuff, dev for my fall course, lab meetings, etc. etc.





## What should I be working on now?

* `writing`: couple of manuscripts back in my hands. 


* `rangeShape3`: do the minor revisions and pass back


* `labSystem?`: dust off old ideas about a lab system, just in case I go back into the lab at some point. 

* `takeStock`: some good, some bad, some unexplored.
