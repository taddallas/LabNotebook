## What have I worked on?
 
* `teary`: talked and drank coffee
 
* `priorityEffects`: polishing touches and submitted.

* `rangeLean`: worked on some conceptual manuscript tweaks. Will dive into analyses this evening. 

* `emergence`: worked on methods and results development. Some tweaks to code file.

* `flatEarth`: some segfault issues I need to fix. Currently running to see when the code chokes. Switched machines and now have the code running in a VM on a different computer in an effort to see if the issue was some dependency or version problem. 





### Tonight 

* `run`
 
* `rangeLean`: play around with code. 

* `emergence`: flesh out the supplement and do some plotting for paragraph 1 of results. 



 
 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `rangeLean` 
 
* `scramble`: model and text dev
