## What have I worked on?

* `besMacro`: attended BES Macroecology conference in Scotland. It was good times. Getting over being a bit under the weather for the past couple days, which is why I haven't updated this. 

* `projects`: `abundanceSDM`, `rangeShapeComment`, `macroHelminth`, and `nodeProperties` accepted for publication. 

* `esaPrep`: Ignite talk and contributed talk slides in place. Ignite has preliminary "script". 

* `hmscMouse`: comments from Anna-Liisa and Otso incorporated. Needs final edits and read through before passing back to them for green light. 

* `alandOcc`: pushed along today. Plotting code set, but will need to re-run one set of models on jarnoX before subset of plots can be made. 

* `abundanceSDM`: final file submission 

* `macroHelminth`: final file submission

* `nodeProperties`: Oikos wanted editable files for proofing. Hopefully the LaTeX code is good enough. 





### Tonight

* `takeStock`: whereami



## What should I be working on now?

* `alandOcc`: push along code and plotting

* `persistDistroX`: check on slow slow slow code.

* `helminthR`: do final final final double check to ensure readiness for submission
