## What have I worked on?

* `spectralSpread`: scoped out a couple of plots and tried to think of a good conceptual figure. This one is a bit slippery.

* `epiControl`: sims done. Pushed along. Real nets are looking a bit 'eh' relative to sims. I think becasue the real networks I examined had a silly-high connectance. 

* `grants`: wrote a couple chunks of text for a grant proposal. Ideas are starting to become a bit more solid.

* `alandCrash`: (yesterday) provided comments on an updated version of this manuscript.

* `biol4253`: lecture today on ecological networks. Some students super interested, others seemed a bit less so. Need to provide more examples in next lecture. 







### Tonight

* `spectralSpread`: kept pushing this along. 







## What should I be working on now?

* `hpcFugazi`: haven't used any of my HPC allocation. Need to fix this, but really just haven't had much time to write code between teaching, recruiting students, getting equipment into the lab, and writing grants. 

* `grants`: need to write words that show my ideas are good and worth investing in.
