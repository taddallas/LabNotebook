## What have I worked on?
 
* `priorityEffects`: changed formatting and incorporated reviewer comments. 

* `alandIdeas`: Pushed along some of the ideas, and read some papers related to the questions of interest. Need to finalize the document and then see if I can pitch some of the ideas to Marjo's group. 

* `annaSDM`: working through the code. Running now, but could fail at any moment. 

* `HMSCmouse`: training single species models currently. Joint models done. 



### Tonight 
 
* `gym`: officially sign up for membership instead of gym shopping. 

 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `aland`: send Marjo an email about ideas and sketch out questions about data structure and stuff I need to know before moving forward. 

* `HMSCmouse`: speed up code
