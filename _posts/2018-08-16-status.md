## What have I worked on?

* `esaTravel`: took a bit, but I'm back from ESA. It was a great conference, and now I'm back and ready to do some science.

* `travelLogistics`: expense reimbursement bs

* `helmSize`: started response to reviewers. Looks good thus far. 

* `bakeoff`: revisions. Positive but extensive. Will help as needed.

* `hmscMouse`: the science I did previously was desk rejected. Will work on making point clear and submit to a more appropriate journal. Read through and started to tweak to emphasize importance. Will meet with AL and O2 next week to discuss changes. 

* `abundOccMoth`: Manuscript writing. 

* `nodeProperties`: proofs submitted.

### Tonight

* `reading`: readdddd

* `persistDistro0`: start exploring output and do some thinking.






## What should I be working on now?

* `alandOcc`: had idea that may be neat. Implement it.

* `persistDistro0`: code finished running. Time to see if there's anything interesting there. I'm hopeful.
