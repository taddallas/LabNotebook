## What have I worked on?
 

* `priorityEffects`: still plodding along. Errors and bugs and models that take forever to fit. 

* `logistics`: talked to a reference letter writer about an upcoming job app submission. 

* `labLogistics`: sent out weekly update and entered some experimental data from `flourTest`

* `researchTalk`: put together a 7 minute pitch of current research for a position. Used gitpitch, which is pretty snazzy. Might use same framework for job talk if I get an interview. 




### Tonight 
 
* `run` 
 
* `read`

* `i3-xMonad`: trackpad on laptop broke. Going to look into using another window managers (currently using openbox) to find one where I never have to touch trackpad. 
 
 


## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `normalNiche`: push text forward 
 
* `nodeProperties`: start response to reviewers 

* `abundanceSDM`: Alan said he'd have comments by Monday, so that will be back on my desk by then

* `flourTest`: read and think more.
