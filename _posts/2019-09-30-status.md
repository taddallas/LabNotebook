## What have I worked on?

It's been too long. My goal is to get at least 2 posts in per week. Much of my time feels like it's dealing with logistics and paperwork. Such is professorship, I guess?


* `pathogensGoneGlobal`: symposium at Duke last week. It was a good time. 

* `abundOcc` and `hmscMouse`: proofs of both and `abundOcc` is out now in early view.

* `spectralSpread` and `epiControl`: pushed along simulations on `beast1`. Core temp around 71C has got me thinking I may need to replace the fan in there or something. Seems a bit warmer than it should run, right?

* `helmCent1/2`: some writing. Passed `helmNAR` to Colin for comments. 

* `BoR-RCS`: grant is pushed along. In Jeremy's hands for final comments. Submission deadline is Oct 15. 

* `frontYardBikes`: Mondays from 3-6 at the bike shop. Learning a lot. Opportunities to build STEM lessons aimed anywhere between K-12. This needs some thinking.





## What should I be working on now?

* `epiControl`: code is almost done running. Bring it off `beast1` and start re-making plots. Edit text. 

* `biol4253`: lecture. Niche evolution and transition into competition. Want to cover competition, community assembly, and diversity estimation before October 17 (next exam). 

* `depscor`: solidify ideas and re-email folks with eligibility question

* `priorityEffects`: the code doesn't take up much memory. Get it running on a lab machine to get the parameter estimate bounds. 

* lots of other stuff.
