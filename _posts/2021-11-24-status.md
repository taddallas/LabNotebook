## What have I worked on?

* `helmCent`: re-submission after responding to reviewers. This may be the last of my work with Pedro Jordano from my time in Spain.

* `grant`: grant text, some budget garbage, etc. 

* `beetles`: got the stocks setup and happy. Did some light packing.

* `reading`: read stuff

* `soldHouse`: barring any wild post-apraisal nonsense, I have sold my house. Not all that fun.




## What should I be working on now?

* `grant`: push forward the DEB idea

* `prep`: still loads to do before moving in a couple weeks
