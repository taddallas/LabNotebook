## What have I worked on?

* `alandOcc`: incorporated Marjo's suggestions. Will submit on Sunday or Monday.

* `abundOcc`: ms dev, clearer demonstration of temporal effect (running on jarno09). Will pass to collabs for final approval soon.

* `helmCent1`: Pedro is reviewing currently. I can still do some dev of `helmCent2`, but I'm curious to see what he thinks first.

* `mothSync`: ms dev, tweaks to conceptual fig, lots of citations added. Manuscript nearly ready to share. 




### Tonight

* `run`

* `logistics`: try to call about moving van rental

* `stuff`




## What should I be working on now?

* `helminthPres`: prep presentation for next week's seminar
