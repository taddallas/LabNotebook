## What have I worked on?

* `lsuLogistics`: international move followed by domestic move. Setting up lab and ordering supplies (desk, computer, etc.). I'll start updating this more frequently when I get my lab machine ordered and set up to my liking. 

* `hmscMouse`: revisions 

* `checkerBoard2`: revisions

* `alandOcc`: got decently positive reviews back on this. 



### Tonight

* `takeStock`


## What should I be working on now?

* `alandOcc`, `hmscMouse`, `checkerBoard2`, `emergence`: revisions

* `lsuLogistics`: continue to order, assemble, and clean.

* `ecology`: push along course materials
