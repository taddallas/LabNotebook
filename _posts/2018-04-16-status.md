## What have I worked on?
 
* `annaSDM`: running somebody else's code. It's been fairly straightforward given the breadth of the project. Kudos to Anna!
 
* `abundanceSDM`: finished responding to reviewers and re-submitted with fingers crossed

* `macroHelminth`: responding to revisions. Fairly slow going, but reviewers had some good suggestions and they will take a bit to incorporate.
 
* `hmscMouse`: started pushing forward manuscript. Nearly read for Otso's input

* `rangeLean`: pushed forward some of this work, but model-data integration is lagging in manuscript. Made Figure 3 to try to link model and data better, but now comes the dreaded interpretation. 

* `cv`: quick update

* `emergence`: pushing along ms with some additional analyses. Intro needs to be edited heavily to back off of prediction as end goal. Prediction still possible, but requires certain assumptions that may be too unrealistic for people wanting to predict these types of events. A trait-based approach is likely better, but that gets us in the weeds about data quality/existence. 





 
### Tonight 
 
* `gym`: finally settled on a gym after shopping around. Will be officially joining today. All this liquorice is going straight to my hips
 
* `emergence`: incorporate variable rolling window size analysis into supplement. 

* `read`: 2 PNAS articles that Andy mentioned. Scaling of persistence times and another on soil microbe communities and niche expansion. 




 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `annaSDM`: keep pushing it along. 

* `rangeLean`: mash theory into data, or data into theory, and write some words. 

* `missingLinks2`: need to dust this one off. I recall some difficulty in selling the message. Prediction isn't enough if some of the predictions seem super unlikely. Not even a great AUC will save me on this point.
