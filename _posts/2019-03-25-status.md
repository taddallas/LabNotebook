## What have I worked on?

* `alandOcc`: submitted

* `email!`: Helsinki email account stopped forwarding messages, so I just dealt with a week or so worth of email. OoooOoooof. 

* `hmscMouse`: model training still coming along. It's sort of silly how slow this is.

* `persistDistro`: dusted the project off and did some minor edits. I really like this project. 

* `rangeNiche1`: continued pushing forward.

* `mothSync`: small polishing edits.







### Tonight

* `helminthPres`: giving a seminar this Thursday. Need to make and prepare.

* `movingLogistics`: ugh.






## What should I be working on now?

* `LSUteaching`: sketched out syllabus, but need to start slowly putting together lectures as time permits.

* `labMeeting`: read paper for lab meeting.
