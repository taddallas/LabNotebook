## What have I worked on?

* `logistics`: grant budget fix, powe app update, 2 reviews, 1 editorial task, 1 pending editorial task, sample protocol to honor's student, ref contacts for potential incoming, acceptance of first graduate student into the lab (yaya!), convocation, `emergence` proofs, etc.

* `mothSync`: incporporated Laura's comments. Looks pretty solid. 

* `rangeNiche1`: reject from Ecology for arguably bad reasons, but addressed concerns and will include reviewer comments with next submission. 




### Tonight

* `biol4253`: prep for tomorrow's lecture on food webs (have notes, but perhaps add more material?)




## What should I be working on now?

* `rangeNiche1`: submit when ready

* `mothSync`: close to submission time

* `grants`: work on getting money for science.

* `thinking`: too much time spent on logistics. Need to sit down and read and think a bit.
