Oof. RCN meeting on the Macroecology of Infectious Disease ended. Another great meeting full of really smart people. Lots of paths forward. I've set up a [Github organization](https://github.com/DiseaseMacroecology) to keep my projects versioned and nice (previously all my projects were in the same private repo, making issue handling for specific projects tough). Hopefully I will be allowed to share my progress on projects openly (minus any sensitive data). More on that in the coming weeks.


## What did I work on today?

* Figured out a weighted network dissimilarity measure (emailed to collabs asking if I'm just being dumb).

* Edits to `FishParasite` manuscript. Responding to reviewers. Formatting code and data for supplement. 


## What should I be working on tomorrow

* `FishParasite` stuff

* `parasiteR` dev, and manuscript edits
