## What have I worked on?

* `macroHelminth`: accepted. Some final formatting things, some unncessary conversions of pdf figures to tif files, and an ask from the editorial team if I can simply share my tex code instead of mangling my beautifully typeset document into .docx garbage. 

* `rangeVar`: read some, coded some. I don't think my initial idea will work, since I can't seem to get generation time data on many species. Need to sit and think of a way around this. 

* `persistDistro1`: code still running on jarno12

* `emergence2`: read DAME paper and emailed Colin a stupid question. 

* `helmSize`: final edits and formatting. Will submit either tonight or tomorrow. 




### Tonight

* `helmSize`: submit.

* `abundanceSDM`: start response to the minor revisions decision. 



## What should I be working on now?

* `persistDistro`: thinking and sketching out intros

* `science`

### Listening to:

You can't make me stop listening to this song on repeat any more than I can stop myself.
