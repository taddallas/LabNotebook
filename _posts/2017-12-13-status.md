## What have I worked on?
 
* `flatEarth`: re-formatted for another journal. 

* `reading`: stress gradient hypothesis reading. What I was thinking about has already been addressed by He et al. (2013). Read some other articles on stochastic population dynamics and some metapopulation articles as well. 

* `holidayParty`: went to it. 

* `labLogistics`: got Christmas schedule decently worked out. Brought two more undergrads in. Katie will be the point person for getting them up to speed. Did a bunch of dishes.


* `HMSC`: played around with the framework more. Still unsure why the interaction coefficients are coming out so odd when applied to certain data types. 




### Tonight 
 
* `newProjects`: think about what directions to go in.
 



 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `flatEarth`: submit when ready (might wait until after Christmas) 

* `read`: read lots and think lots.
