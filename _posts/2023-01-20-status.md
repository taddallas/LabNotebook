## What have I worked on?

* `labMeeting`: lab meeting and one-on-one meetings today. 

* `centerGrant`: chatted with Nolan about center grant full proposal

* `rViews`: minor polishing edits and passed to potential collaborator for comments/thoughts

* `bdhscGrant`: small internal grant that would fund Grant to do some neat modeling work. Worked on it a bit, but need more clear public health tie-ins. 

* `shopping`: some Amazon ordering for lab supplies

* `labCleaning`: wet lab cleaning and organization. Moved high memory machines to make another place for an undergrad researcher to sit. Grabbing computer and monitor from IT on Monday to complete the setup. 




### Tonight

* `bike`: did not have time to work out for the past 2 days. So at least an hour today and a longer ride tomorrow. 





## What should I be working on now?

* `grantDev`: need money to do research, turns out.

* `rangeNiche2`: do some writing and dev on it

* `websiteDev`: seminar on Monday, so prep for those bits

* `centerGrant`: read and think critically about aims 1 and 3 for meetings on Monday and Tuesday
