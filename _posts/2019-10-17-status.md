## What have I worked on?


* `professionalService`: reviewed a manuscript, agreed to review another.

* `BoR`: grant edits. uploaded the documentation. Re-wrote my CV into their stupid format for some reason. Re-wrote a bunch of shit into their format for some reason. Nearly ready to submit. 

* `rangeShape2`: running sims and getting stuff setup a bit better on `beast` machines

* `emergence`: paid the APCs. Took more time than I feel like it should have. 

* `macroGrant`: wrote some words. 

* `read`: Diversity and scaling in microbial species (Grili pre-print). Super good, but tough to get through.




### Tonight

* `biol4253`: grade some more

* `run`

* `read` 




## What should I be working on now?

* `macroGrant`: continue slowly pushing this one along

* `otherStuff`: some projects in other hands (e.g., `helmCent1`)
