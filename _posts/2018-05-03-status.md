## What have I worked on?

* `persistDistro`: formatted SIN networks, re-read some key papers, and pushed this forward pretty solidly. Need to incorporate out of sample persistence time stuff. Probably needs some simulation study to accompany the empirical side. 

* `macroHelminth`: did some last minute analyses for the supplement. Revisions due tomorrow. 

* `annaSDM`: things finished running. Have some output and some notes. 


 
### Tonight 
 
* `macroHelminth`: finalize edits, responses, and cover letter

* `run` 

 
 
## What should I be working on now? 
 
* `macroHelminth`: submit revisions

* `annaSDM`: meeting with Anna in afternoon.
