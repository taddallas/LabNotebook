## What have I worked on?

* `moth`: coded up an interesting null model, partitioned out data based on temporal resolution to examine the effect of seasonality, and did some preliminary plotting. Need to read more to get a better feeling of what's been done in this arena

* `helmSize`: started setting up revisions. Will dive into this after ESA probably.




### Tonight

* `beer`: drink some beer and watch Twin Peaks. 



## What should I be working on now?

* `moth`: push along

* `esaTalks`: run through talks a couple of times. Tweak slides as need be. I do not enjoy giving talks.

* `rangeLean`: read and write some of the results and discussion. Re-make some of the plots.
