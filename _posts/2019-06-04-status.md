## What have I worked on?

* `spectralSpread`: some tweaks to code and pushing forward some simulation pieces

* `rangeShape2`: saw a bit of a conceptual gap, so wrote some code to fill in. Now running simulations. Also did a fair bit of writing on this one. 

* `logistics`: started a grant application as a way to cement some larger conceptual ideas. 

* `lifeLogistics`: some money transfer stuff and getting ready for move back to the US







### Tonight

* `run`: weather is nice, so time to get some good training in.

* `read`: plenty of tabs open. 





## What should I be working on now?

* `howManyHelminths`: Colin's pushing along writing. Do some spatial stuff once you get the data. 

* `courseMaterials`: keep pushing along.
