## What have I worked on?

* `rangeNiche1`: pretty much the whole day absorbed by this. Some new analysis, pretty plots, and a lot of writing. One more good push and this will be ready to share. 





### Tonight

* `mothSync`: didn't do it last night. Maybe tonight if I feel like it?





## What should I be working on now?

* `sevilla`: push along protocol and side project ideas

* `alandOcc`: add in Otso's idea about spatial partitioning
