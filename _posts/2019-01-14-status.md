## What have I worked on?

* `hmscMouse`: still pushing it forward in spite of certain R packages being garbage

* `alandOcc`: models running for the final time (hopefully). Going to re-make plots based on Otso's suggestions, and then edit text to discuss the spatial effects a bit more. Marjo is good with it 

* `emergence`: read through and thought about edits. Made new conceptual figure 

* `reading`: some good stuff

* `labMeeting`: also some good stuff (presenting next week)





### Tonight

* `run`

* `sevilla`: keep pushing along the protocol





## What should I be working on now?

* `professionalService`: review article (maybe wait until Ivalo for this)

* `mothSync`: reading, some analysis, maybe some introduction writing

* `rangeNiche2`: sketch this out and see if it's viable (might be a silly idea)
