## What have I worked on?

* `professionalService`: submitted review

* `persistDistro`: dusted this one off, and pushed forward some text edits. Passed to co-authors.

* `labMeeting`: Marjo's lab meeting. I brought Reece's PB cups. They were not a hit. 

* `alandOcc`: polishing manuscript text. Incorporated Marjo's comments. Emailed co-authors to set up meeting to go through the work together so that everyone is happy with it.




### Tonight

* `mothSync`: start dev on protocol





## What should I be working on now?


* `rangeNiche1`: writing

* `sevilla`: clearly outline project and potential side projects
