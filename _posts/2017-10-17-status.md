## What have I worked on?
 
* `beetleMeeting`: touched base on ongoing projects and pushed forward the `priorityEffects` likelihood testing and such. 

* `parasitePartition`: started data cleaning and pre-processing code

* `graphDissim`: manuscript re-submitted to _Ecography_ with fingers crossed.

* `flourTest`: more thinking about habitat size in the beetle system, some initial plotting. I want to this to have a nice theory component. 



### Tonight 
 
* `parasitePartition`: push along. 
 
* `run`


 
 
## What should I be working on now? 

* `rangeLean`: push along soon. Waiting on small tweak from Robin, though I don't think I really need to (perhaps push this along tomorrow)
 
* `flourTest`: keep at it
