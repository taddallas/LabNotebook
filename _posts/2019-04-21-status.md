## What have I worked on?

* `sevilla`: haven't posted in awhile here, because of some last pushes on projects with Pedro (`helmCent` and `helmNAR` mainly). Also spent a bit of time unwinding in la rioja and Madrid. Most of the logistics done regarding the paperwork from the HPC-Europa visit. Need to submit a final report, which I've almost completed. Getting settled back in Helsinki now. 




### Tonight

* `easter`: do easter stuff


## What should I be working on now?

* `professionalService`: review 2 articles 

* `helmCent2`: finish and pass to Pedro

* `hmscMouse`: it will never end, because every package update breaks all existing functionality.

* `lsuLogistics`: some hiring stuff, need to continue working on course dev, and getting lists ready for ordering once account can be used.

* `abundOcc`: finalize submission

* `rangeShape2`: analysis and plotting
